<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I stepped on to the platform
at Nairobi I hadn&rsquo;t the very least idea of what I was in
for.&nbsp; The train for which we were waiting was due from
Kisumu, bringing with it a number of Indian sepoys, captured at
Tanga and Jasin, whom the Belgian advance on Taborah had
freed.&nbsp; It was my job to see them into the ambulances and
send them off to hospital.&nbsp; But when I got to the station I
found the platform swarming with clerical hats and women who
looked religious, all of whom couldn&rsquo;t very well have been
swept into this degree of congregation for the sake of an odd
sepoy&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; These mean and ill-dressed people kept
up a chatter like starlings under the station roof.&nbsp; It was
a hot day in November, and the rains were due.&nbsp; Even six
thousand feet of altitude won&rsquo;t stimulate you then.&nbsp;
It had all the atmosphere of a sticky school treat in August at
home. . . .&nbsp; Baptists on an August Bank Holiday.&nbsp; That
was how it struck me.</p>
<p>And anyway it was a nuisance: I couldn&rsquo;t get my
ambulances on to the platform.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, sir, it
isn&rsquo;t <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>a norspital train,&rdquo; said the military policeman,
&ldquo;only a nordinary passenger train from the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him what all the crowd was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; he replied cautiously, &ldquo;as the
missionaries is coming down.&nbsp; Them that was German
prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that was it.&nbsp; And a few minutes later the clumsy train
groaned in, and the engine stood panting as though it were out of
breath, as do all the wood-fuel engines of the Uganda
Railway.&nbsp; The shabby people on the platform sent up an
attempt at a cheer.&nbsp; I suppose they were missionaries
too.&nbsp; My wounded sepoys had to wait until these martyrs were
disgorged.</p>
<p>Poor devils. . . .&nbsp; They were a sad-looking crowd.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t suppose Taborah in war-time had been a bed of
roses: and yet . . . and yet one couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that
these strange-looking creatures invited persecution.&nbsp; The
men, I mean.&nbsp; Oh yes, I was properly ashamed of myself the
next moment: but there&rsquo;s something about long-necked
humility in clerical clothes that stirs up the savage in one,
particularly when it moves slowly and with weak knees.&nbsp; Now
to the cheers tears were added.&nbsp; They wept, these good
people, and were very fluttered and hysterical: and the
prisoners, poor souls, looked as if they didn&rsquo;t know where
they were.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t they who did the crying.&nbsp; I
dare say, after all, they were quite admirable people and felt as
sick at being slobbered over by over-emotional women as I did
watching the progress.&nbsp; Gradually all of them were whipped
off into cars that were <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>waiting outside and conveyed, no
doubt, to Christian homes where the house-boys come in for
evening prayers.&nbsp; All of them except one. . . .</p>
<p>I had noticed her from the first: principally, I imagine,
because she seemed horribly out of it, standing, somehow,
extraordinarily aloof from the atmosphere of emotionalism which
bathed the assembly as in weak tea.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t look
their sort.&nbsp; And it wasn&rsquo;t only that her face showed a
little tension&mdash;such a small thing&mdash;about the eyes, as
though the whole thing (very properly) gave her a headache.&nbsp;
And I think that if she hadn&rsquo;t been so dreadfully tired she
would have smiled.&nbsp; As it was, nobody seemed to take any
notice of her, and I could have sworn that she was thankful for
it.&nbsp; But that wasn&rsquo;t the only reason why I was
interested in her.&nbsp; In spite of the atrocious black clothes
which she wore, and which obviously hadn&rsquo;t been made for
her, she was really very beautiful, and this was a thing which
could not be said of any other woman on the platform.&nbsp; But
the thing which most intrigued me was the peculiar type of beauty
which her pale face brought back to me, after many years.&nbsp;
This girl&rsquo;s face, happily unconscious of my gaze, was the
spring of a sudden inspiration of the kind which is most precious
to those who love England and live in alien lands: it brought to
me, suddenly and with a most poignant tenderness, the atmosphere
of that sad and beautiful country which lies along the March of
Wales.&nbsp; Other things will work the same magic: a puff of
wood smoke; a single note in a bird&rsquo;s song; a shaft of
sunlight or a billow of cloud.&nbsp; <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>But here the impression was
inconceivably distinct; so distinct that I could almost have
affirmed the existence of some special bond between her and that
country, and said: &ldquo;This woman comes from the Welsh Marches
somewhere between Ludlow and Usk, where the women have pale skins
of an incredible delicacy, and straight eyebrows and serious dark
eyes, and a sort of woodland magic of their own.&nbsp; And their
voices . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; I was certain that I knew what her
voice would be like: so certain that I took the risk of
disappointment and passed near her in the hopes that soon
somebody would speak to her and then she would answer.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t have to wait long.&nbsp; A bustling female who oozed
good works drew near.&nbsp; She held out her hand in welcome as
she advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, are you Miss Burwarton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And my girl shivered.&nbsp; It was a little shiver which I
don&rsquo;t suppose anyone else noticed.&nbsp; But why should she
have shivered at her own name?</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Eva Burwarton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was right.&nbsp; Beyond doubt I was right.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;i&rdquo; sound was deliciously pure, the &ldquo;r&rdquo;
daintily liquid.&nbsp; Oh, I knew the sound well enough.&nbsp; My
vision had been justified.</p>
<p>The bustling woman spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, Mr. Oddy has been telling me about your poor
dear brother.&nbsp; So sad . . . such a terrible loss for
you.&nbsp; But the Lord . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear what precisely the Lord had done in this
case, for a group of Sisters of Mercy in pale blue uniforms and
white caps passed between us, but I saw <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the appropriate and pious gloom
gathering on Mrs. Somebody&rsquo;s face, and in the face of Eva
Burwarton not the shadow of a reply, not the faintest gleam of
sympathy or remembered grief.</p>
<p>Good Lord, I thought, this is an extraordinary girl who
can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t raise the flicker of an eyelid when
she&rsquo;s being swamped with condolences about a brother to
whom something horrible has evidently happened.&nbsp; And then
the busy woman swept her away, and all the length of the platform
I watched her beautiful, pale, serious face.&nbsp; And with her
going that sudden vision, that atmosphere which still enwrapped
me, faded, and I turned to the emptier end of the platform, where
the wounded sepoys were squatting, looking as pathetic as only
sick Indians can.&nbsp; And I was back in Nairobi again, with low
clouds rolling over the parched Athi Plains, and the earth and
the air and every living creature athirst for rain and the relief
of thunder.&nbsp; A funny business . . .</p>
<p>But all that day the moment haunted me: that, and the
girl&rsquo;s white face and serious brows, and the extraordinary
incongruity of her ill-made, ill-fitting dress with her pale
beauty.&nbsp; And her name, Eva Burwarton, which seemed somehow
strangely representative of her tragic self.&nbsp; At first I
couldn&rsquo;t place it at all.&nbsp; It sounded like Warburton
gone wrong.&nbsp; And then when I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of
anything in particular, I remembered that there was a village of
that name somewhere near Wenlock Edge.&nbsp; And once again with
a thrill I realised that I was right.</p>
<p>And after that I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of her.&nbsp; I
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>can&rsquo;t
exactly say why.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it was for the sake of
her physical attractions: indeed, when I came to speak to her,
when in the end she was driven, poor thing, into a certain degree
of intimacy with me, I believe this aspect of her was quite
forgotten.&nbsp; No . . .&nbsp; I think the attraction which she
exercised over me was simply due to the curious suggestiveness
which clung to her, the thing which had set me dreaming of a
place or an atmosphere which it was an ecstasy to remember, and
the flattering discovery that I had something more than
imagination on which to build.&nbsp; And then, when my
friendliness, the mere fact that we had something, even if it
were only a memory, in common had surprised her into getting the
inexpressible story off her mind, the awful spiritual intensity
of the thing was so great that everything else about her was
forgotten; she became no more than the fragile, and in glimpses
the pathetic, vehicle of the drama.&nbsp; Nothing more: though,
of course, it was easy enough for anyone who had eyes to see why
poor old M&lsquo;Crae (<i>alias</i> Hare) had fallen in love with
her.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But at first, as I say, it was nothing more than the flavour
of the country-side which she carried with her that held
me.&nbsp; When next I saw her she had shed a little of that
tender radiance.&nbsp; She had been furnished by some charitable
person with clothing less grotesque.&nbsp; She certainly
wasn&rsquo;t so indefinitely tragic; but now that she was less
tired her country complexion&mdash;so <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>very different from the parched skins
of women who have lived for long in the East African
highlands&mdash;made her noticeable.</p>
<p>She had been dumped by Mr. Oddy&rsquo;s friend (or wife, for
all I know) into the Norfolk Hotel, the oldest and most reputable
house in Nairobi, and it was in the gloomy lounge of this place
that I was introduced to her by the only respectable woman I was
privileged to know in the Protectorate.&nbsp; She said:
&ldquo;Cheer her up . . . there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s lost her brother, poor thing!&nbsp; A missionary, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I proceeded to cheer up Eva Burwarton.&nbsp; My methods
didn&rsquo;t answer very well.&nbsp; It was obvious that she
wasn&rsquo;t used to the kind of nonsense which men talk.&nbsp;
She took me very seriously, or rather, literally.&nbsp; I
thought: &ldquo;She has no sense of humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
hadn&rsquo;t . . . of my kind.&nbsp; And all the time those
frightfully serious dark eyes of hers, which had never yet lost
their hint of suffering, seemed full of a sort of dumb reproach,
as if the way in which I was talking wasn&rsquo;t really fair on
her.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t realise then what a child she was or a
hundredth part of what she had endured.&nbsp; I knew nothing
about M&lsquo;Crae (<i>alias</i> Hare) or Godovius, or of that
dreadful mission house on the edge of the M&rsquo;ssente
Swamp.&nbsp; And if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that fortunate
vision of mine on the station platform I don&rsquo;t suppose that
I should ever have known at all.&nbsp; The thing would have
passed me by, as I suppose terrible and intense drama passes one
by every day of one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; An amazing thing. . .
.&nbsp; You would have thought that a story of that kind would <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>cry out to the
whole world from the face of every person who had taken part in
it, that it simply couldn&rsquo;t remain hidden behind a pale,
childish face with puzzled eyes.</p>
<p>But when we seemed to be getting no further, and whatever else
I may have done, I certainly hadn&rsquo;t cheered her at all, I
brought out the fruits of my deduction.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you come from Shropshire or Hereford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly her whole face brightened, and the eyes which had
been gazing at nothing really looked at me.&nbsp; Now, more than
ever, I was overwhelmed with their childishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but how do you know?&rdquo; she cried, and in that
moment more than ever confirmed me.&nbsp; I know that inflection
so well.</p>
<p>It was Shropshire, she said.&nbsp; Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t
know the place; it was too small.&nbsp; Just a little group of
cottages on a hilly road between the Severn and Brown Clee.&nbsp;
I pressed her for the name of it.&nbsp; A funny name, she
said.&nbsp; It was called Far Forest.</p>
<p>I told her that veritably I knew it.&nbsp; Her eyes
glowed.&nbsp; Strange that so simple a thing should give birth to
beautiful delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the house
in which I was born.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe that I shall see
it again.&nbsp; I sometimes feel as if I&rsquo;ve only dreamed
about it.&nbsp; Although it was so quiet and ordinary, it&rsquo;s
just like a dream to me.&nbsp; The other part is more real . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the light went from her eyes.</p>
<p>But I think it did her good to talk about it.&nbsp; She <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was cheering
herself up.&nbsp; And between us we pieced together a fairly
vivid picture of the scattered group of houses above the forest
of Wyre, where the highroad from Bewdley climbs to a place called
Clows Top, which is often verily in cloud.&nbsp; There, we
agreed, a narrow lane tumbles between cider orchards to a gate in
the forest, that old forest of dwarf oak and hazel; and there the
steep path climbs to a green space at the edge of a farm, where
there is a duck-pond and a smooth green in which great stones are
embedded, and nobody knows where the stones came from.&nbsp; And
from this green you can see the comb of Clee, Brown Clee and
Titterstone in two great waves, and hear, on a Sunday evening,
the church bells of Mamble and Pensax, villages whose names are
music in themselves.&nbsp; And if you came back over the crest at
sundown the lane would bring you out on the main road exactly
opposite to the little house in which her father kept the general
shop.&nbsp; Over the door there was a weather-beaten legend:
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Aaron Burwarton</span>, Licensed to
Sell Tobacco&rdquo;; and if it were summertime as like as not
Aaron Burwarton himself would be sitting at the door in a white
apron, not smoking, for he disapproved of tobacco, even though he
sold it, and the westering sun would light up his placid,
white-bearded face.&nbsp; People live easy lives in those parts .
. . the quietest under the sun.&nbsp; All the walls of the house
were beaten and weathered by wind and driving rain; and inside
you would inhale the clean provocative odours of the general
shop: soap, and bacon, and a hint of paraffin.&nbsp; She was
delightfully <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>ingenuous and happy about it all, and I was happy
too.&nbsp; We sat and talked, in the gloomy Norfolk lounge; and
outside the tropical night fell: the flat banana leaves stirred
against the sky, the cicalas began their trilling chorus, and on
the roof of the verandah little lizards stole quietly
about.&nbsp; It was a surprising thing that we two should be
sitting there talking of Far Forest.&nbsp; I said so.&nbsp; I
said: &ldquo;Why in the world are you here?&nbsp; What were you
doing in German East?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I could see she was not afraid of letting me into her
confidence.&nbsp; I am not sure that she wasn&rsquo;t glad to do
so.&nbsp; Even if it didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;cheer her
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a long story, she said, beginning, oh,
far away at home.&nbsp; The whole business had followed on quite
naturally from a chapel service at Far Forest when she was quite
a child.&nbsp; Her brother James was a little older than
herself.&nbsp; And her father (this not without pride) was an
elder of the chapel.&nbsp; A Mr. Misquith, she said, had driven
up from Bewdley to preach about foreign missions: about
Africa.&nbsp; Father had driven him up in the trap, and he had
stayed to dinner.&nbsp; James, she said, had always been a clever
boy and very fond of books.&nbsp; It had been father&rsquo;s
great wish that James should some day enter the ministry.&nbsp;
Not that he would have influenced him for a minute.&nbsp; Father
held awfully strong views on that sort of thing.&nbsp; He
believed in a &ldquo;call.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wondered if she did
too.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I was born
religious,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; But James was . . .</p>
<p>We were launched into a detailed recital of James&rsquo;
childhood, and it gave me the impression of just the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>queer,
centripetal, limited sort of life which you could imagine people
living at Far Forest, a life that sought ideals, but ideals of
such an incredible humility.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I had ever
realised the horizons of an average Nonconformist family in a
remote hamlet before.&nbsp; Old Burwarton himself was very far
removed from that, and as for the children. . . .&nbsp; No; it
was in relation to the events that came afterwards, the story
that was gradually and in the simplest manner shaping before my
imagination, that the environment of the Burwartons&rsquo;
childhood struck me as humble and limited.&nbsp; People who are
brought up in that way don&rsquo;t usually find themselves forced
into a highly coloured tropical melodrama, or, what is more, take
their places in the scheme of it as if they had been specially
created for that purpose.&nbsp; It was for this reason that I was
content to consider James in some detail.</p>
<p>He had been, she said, a delicate child; but always so
clever.&nbsp; Such a scholar.&nbsp; That was how she seriously
put it.&nbsp; The little glazed bookshelf in the parlour had been
full of his school prizes, and the walls with framed certificates
of virtue and proficiency and God knows what else.&nbsp; And at
quite an early age he had learned to play the harmonium. . .
.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had an American organ.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what an American organ is, but I was quite
satisfied with the picture of James playing Moody and Sankey
hymns, which, if I remember rightly, deal mainly with <span
class="smcap">The Blood</span>, on Sunday afternoon, while old
Mr. Burwarton sat by the fireside with a great Bible in his
lap.&nbsp; Later she showed me a photograph of James: &ldquo;He
was <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>supposed to be very like me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And
perhaps he was. . . .&nbsp; Yes, he certainly had the same
straight brows, the same colouring of ivory and black; but his
mouth was wholly lacking in that little determined line which
made Eva&rsquo;s so peculiarly attractive.&nbsp; And I am almost
sure that James had adenoids as a child, for in the photo his
lips were parted, his nose a little compressed, and the upper lip
too short.&nbsp; And later, she told me, because of the headaches
which came with &ldquo;too much study,&rdquo; he had to wear
glasses; but in the photograph which she showed me you could see
his dark eyes, the distant eyes of a visionary.&nbsp; I suppose
in the class from which he came there are any number of young men
of this kind, born mystics with a thirst for beauty which might
be slaked in any glorious way, yet finds its satisfaction in the
only revelation that comes their way in a religion from which
even the Reformation has not banished all beauty
whatsoever.&nbsp; They find what they seek in religion, in music
(such music! . . . but I suppose it&rsquo;s better than nothing),
in the ardours of love-making; and they go out, the poor,
uncultured children that they are, into the &ldquo;foreign
mission field,&rdquo; and for sheer want of education and breadth
of outlook die there . . . the most glorious, the most pitiful of
failures.&nbsp; That, I suppose, is where Christianity comes
in.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t mind being the failures that they
are.&nbsp; Oh yes, James was sufficiently consistent . . .</p>
<p>From school, the existence of a &ldquo;call&rdquo; having now
been recognised, James had passed to college&mdash;the North
Bromwich Theological College.&nbsp; Theology <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>means Hebrew
and New Testament Greek, a timid glance at the thing they call
the Higher Criticism, and a working acquaintance with the modern
pillars of Nonconformity.&nbsp; From the study of Theology James
had issued in the whole armour of Light, ready to deal with any
problem which human passion or savage tradition might put to
him.</p>
<p>One gasps at the criminal, self-sufficient ignorance of the
people that sent him to Central Africa, at the innocence of the
man himself, who felt that he was in a position to go; for
forlorner hope it would be impossible to imagine.&nbsp; Here, as
in other cases of which I have heard, there was no shadow of an
attempt at adjustment.&nbsp; James Burwarton went to Luguru to
battle with his personal devil&mdash;and he hadn&rsquo;t reckoned
with Godovius at that&mdash;very much as he might have gone to a
Revival meeting in the Black Country.&nbsp; Fortified with
prayer. . . .&nbsp; Oh, no doubt.&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
betting he went there in a collar that buttoned at the back and a
black coat with flapping skirts.&nbsp; To Equatorial
Africa.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen it.&nbsp; One of Eva&rsquo;s
friends from Taborah was wearing one.&nbsp; Nor was that the only
way in which I imagine his hope forlorn.&nbsp; He had gone there
with the wrong sort of religion: with the wrong brand, if you
like, of Christianity.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t replace a fine
exciting business of midnight n&rsquo;gomas and dancing
ceremonies by a sober teaching of Christian ethics without any
exciting ritual attached, without any reasonable dilution with
magic or mystery.&nbsp; The Roman missionaries in Africa know all
about that.&nbsp; But James was prepared simply, to <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>sit down in
his black coat while a sort of reverent indaba of savages drank
in the Sermon on the Mount, and forthwith proceeded to put it
into practice.&nbsp; Ritual of any kind was abhorrent to
him.&nbsp; Personality, example . . . those were the things that
counted, said James.&nbsp; Personality!&nbsp; Compare the force
of his personality with that of Godovius.&nbsp; Think of him
dashing out milk and water ethics to the Masai, and then of
Godovius with his deep knowledge of the origins of religion in
man, with his own crazy enthusiasms added to a cult the most
universal and savagely potent of any that has ever shaken
humanity.&nbsp; I wish that James were not such a pathetic
figure.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help seeing his pale face with Eva
Burwarton&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the very devil . . .</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>And so to Africa.&nbsp; In the ordinary way Eva would not have
gone with him; but it so happened that only a month before he was
due to sail the old general shopkeeper died, and everybody seemed
to think that it would not be the right thing to leave the girl
behind.&nbsp; Far Forest, they said, was not the place for a
single young woman, implying, one supposes, that the Luguru
mission was.&nbsp; And it would be so much better for James, they
said, delicate, and a favourite, with all the makings of a martyr
in him, to have someone to look after him; presumably to put on a
clean collar for him before he went out converting the
heathen.&nbsp; And so Eva went.&nbsp; She just went because she
hadn&rsquo;t anywhere else to go.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any
fine <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Apostolic fervour about her venture, nor even, for that
matter, any great sisterly affection.&nbsp; She admitted to me
that she had never understood James.&nbsp; If she hadn&rsquo;t
been convinced that it was her duty to love him I think she would
really have disliked him.&nbsp; But she too, for all her fine
frank naturalness, had been brought up in the school of the old
man Burwarton at Far Forest: it was partly that which made her so
attractive&mdash;the spectacle of an almost constant conflict
between instinct and education going on behind those dark eyes of
hers.&nbsp; But then, of course, no one in the world can have
seen that in the same way as Hector M&lsquo;Crae . . .&nbsp;
Perhaps that was partly the reason why he fell in love with
her.</p>
<p>At any rate brother and sister embarked at London, steerage,
on some Castle or other, for Durban.&nbsp; They went by the
Cape.&nbsp; It was a very hot passage, and the boat, which called
at St. Helena, was slow.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the
voyage.&nbsp; In the steerage there were a lot of low-class Jews
going out to Johannesburg.&nbsp; Even then she disliked
Jews.&nbsp; Besides these there were a number of young domestic
servants travelling in charge of a sort of matron, an elderly
woman who was paid for the work by the society which arranged the
assisted passages.&nbsp; Eva rather liked her; for she was kind
and excessively motherly.&nbsp; What is more, she took her work
seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of these young persons are so
simple,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the fellers . . .&nbsp;
Well, I suppose there&rsquo;s nothing else to do on
board.&rdquo;&nbsp; A human and charitable way of looking at the
problem to which she owed her office.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>she, as a
matter of fact, who relieved Eva of the attentions of the third
engineer, who habitually sought diversions in the steerage.&nbsp;
They were passing through the oily seas about the Equator.&nbsp;
The nights were languid, and Jupiter shed a track over the smooth
waves almost like that of the moon.&nbsp; The third engineer was
rather nice, she said, at first.&nbsp; His uniform.&nbsp; Until
one night . . . but the Emigrants&rsquo; Matron had put him in
his place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your brother should be looking after you
by rights,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But then, what does he
know about that sort of thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; On Sundays glimpses
of heaven, as typified by the First Saloon, were vouchsafed to
them.&nbsp; Indeed, James, who was the only parson aboard, had
taken the service and even preached a short sermon.&nbsp; He was
rather flattered by the politeness of the First-Class people, who
took it all in with innocence and serenity.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
were nice to us,&rdquo; said Eva, &ldquo;because they wanted to
assure their own souls that they weren&rsquo;t mean in despising
us.&nbsp; I knew . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from a stuffy coasting steamer that paused as it were for
breath at every possible inlet from Chindi to Dar-es-Salaam they
were thrust panting into Africa, into the sudden, harsh glories
of the tropics, into that &ldquo;vast, mysterious
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mysterious . . . that was the adjective which
people always used in talking about Africa . . . I beg their
pardon . . . the Dark Continent&mdash;and to my mind no word in
the language could be less appropriate.&nbsp; There is nothing
really mysterious about Africa.&nbsp; Mystery is a thing of
man&rsquo;s imagining, and springs, if you will, from an air <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>which
generations of dead men have breathed, emanates from the crumbled
bricks with which they have builded, from the memory of the loves
and aspirations of an immemorial past.&nbsp; But this land has no
past: no high intelligence has made the air subtly alive with the
vibrations of its dreams.&nbsp; And another thing which the word
mysterious implies is the element of shock or surprise, while in
Africa there is nothing more rare.&nbsp; From the Zambesi to the
Nile a vast plateau, rarely broken, spreads; and on its
desolation the same life springs, the same wastes of thorny
scrub, the same river belts of perennial forest, the same herds
of beasts, the same herds of men.</p>
<p>Into the centre of this vast monotony the Burwartons were
plunged.&nbsp; By rail, for a hundred miles or so up the Central
Railway to the point where the missionary whom they were
relieving met them.&nbsp; He might have waited at Luguru to see
them into the house, they thought.&nbsp; But he was in a hurry to
get away.&nbsp; He said so: made no attempt to disguise it.&nbsp;
Eva said from the first: &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s hiding
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; But James wouldn&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp;
They had talked a little about the work.&nbsp; A stubborn field
apparently . . . and yet such possibilities!&nbsp; So many dark
souls to be enlightened, and almost virgin soil.&nbsp; James
thrilled.&nbsp; He was anxious to get to work.&nbsp; The things
which Bullace, the retiring minister, had told him had set fire
to his imagination, so that for days on end he moved about in a
state of rapt emotion.</p>
<p>But Eva wasn&rsquo;t going to leave it at the stage of vague
enthusiasms.&nbsp; She wanted to know about the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>house.&nbsp;
Mr. Bullace had been unmarried: his housework had been done by
two native boys of the Waluguru tribe.&nbsp; Their names were
Hamisi and Onyango.&nbsp; Oh yes, good boys both of them.&nbsp;
Excellent boys, and Christians, of course.&nbsp; He had to
confess that the house wasn&rsquo;t up to much.&nbsp; The garden?
. . .&nbsp; He feared the garden had been rather neglected.&nbsp;
But then the work . . .&nbsp; He hoped, hoped with rather an
exaggerated zeal, she thought, that they would be happy.&nbsp; It
would be strange for a white woman to live at Luguru: such a
thing had never happened before.</p>
<p>She wanted to know about neighbours.&nbsp; Well, strictly
speaking, there weren&rsquo;t any there, except Herr Godovius, a
big owner of plantations.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to want to
talk about Godovius; which was quite the worst thing he could
have done, for it made her suspicious.&nbsp; For James.&nbsp;
That was always the funny part of her: she wasn&rsquo;t really
fond of James (she admitted as much), and yet she always regarded
herself in some sort as his protector, and was quick to scent any
hostility towards him in others or even by any threat to his
peace of mind.&nbsp; She regarded him more or less as a
child.&nbsp; And so he was, after all . . .</p>
<p>Now she didn&rsquo;t give poor, shaky Mr. Bullace any
peace.&nbsp; By hedging he had put her hot on the scent; she
tackled him with that peculiar childish directness of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with this Mr. . . . Mr.
Godovius?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Mr.
Bullace couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t tell her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing really the matter with him,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In some ways you&rsquo;ll find him . . . oh
. . . kind&mdash;extraordinarily kind.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
to prejudice you against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what you are doing, Mr.
Bullace,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to start with a clean sheet, so to
speak.&nbsp; I want you to be happy at Luguru.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t
really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by that she knew that he did.&nbsp; Indeed I pity little
Mr. Bullace under Eva&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>James was different, very different.&nbsp; He mopped up all
that Mr. Bullace could tell him about the people: how this
village chief was a reliable man; how another was suspected of
backslidings; a third, regrettably, a thief.&nbsp; James took
shorthand notes in a penny exercise-book.&nbsp; But he
couldn&rsquo;t help noticing how ill and haggard Mr. Bullace
looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work has told on you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Bullace admitted, the work had told on him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will not be so
lonely.&nbsp; Loneliness counts for a lot.&nbsp; That and
fever.&nbsp; Have you plenty of quinine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to face that sort of thing,&rdquo; said
James.&nbsp; &ldquo;One reckons with that from the
start.&rdquo;&nbsp; He even glowed in anticipation.&nbsp; He
would have blessed malaria as a means to salvation.&nbsp; Eva,
listening to his enthusiasms, and what she took to be Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s gently evasive replies, smiled to herself.&nbsp;
She wondered where she came in.</p>
<h2><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Mr. Bullace left
them.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t really anything suspicious about
his haste; for if he hadn&rsquo;t gone down the line that day he
would have had to forfeit a month or more of his leave by missing
the boat.&nbsp; From the railway the two Burwartons set off
northward.&nbsp; Luguru was distant six days&rsquo; safari: in
other words, between seventy and eighty miles.</p>
<p>Of course this journey was very wonderful for Eva.&nbsp; I
suppose there is no existence more delightful than that of the
wanderer in Africa, in fair weather, particularly in these
highlands, where the nights are always cool, and the grassy
plains all golden in the early morning when most of the
journeying is done.&nbsp; To these dwellers in the cloudy Severn
valley was given a new intoxication of sunlight, of endless
smiling days.&nbsp; And the evenings were as wonderful as the
earlier hours; for then the land sighed, as with relief from a
surfeit of happiness; when night unfolded a sky of unusual
richness decked with strange lights more brilliant than the misty
starshine of home.&nbsp; James Burwarton too was sensitive to the
magnificence of these.&nbsp; From a friend at
&ldquo;college&rdquo; he had picked up a few of the names of <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Northern
constellations; but many of these stars troubled him by their
strangeness.&nbsp; The brother and sister sat together alone in
the dark watching the sky.&nbsp; Alone in the middle of
Africa.&nbsp; James&rsquo; imagination struggled with the
idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that even the
stars are different.&nbsp; One might be in another
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adventure enough for the most exacting of
devotees!&nbsp; The sight of this starry beauty filled him with a
desire to moralise.&nbsp; With Eva it was quite different.&nbsp;
To her their loveliness and strangeness were
self-sufficient.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that I simply moved along in a sort of dream.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t pretend to take it all in then, but now I seem to
remember every step of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was one of the characteristics of the girl which I
quickly discovered: she had an almost infallible sense of
country&mdash;a rare thing in a woman.&nbsp; Thanks to this, I
have now almost as clear a conception of the Luguru mission and
its surroundings as if I had been there myself.&nbsp; The lie of
the whole land was implicit in her account of their first arrival
there.</p>
<p>It was evening, she said&mdash;the sixth evening of their
safari.&nbsp; All day long they had been pushing their way
through moderately dense thorn bush.&nbsp; Awfully hot work it
was, with the smell of an orangey sort of herb in the air: like
oranges mixed with another scent . . . mint, or something of that
kind.&nbsp; She was rather tired; for she had been walking most
of the day, preferring that sort of fatigue to the sea-sickness
of riding in a <i>machila</i>.&nbsp; All along the road the
tsetses had been flicking at them as if they must bite or die,
and Eva&rsquo;s ankles were swollen with tick bites.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>And
then suddenly, just as the evening grew calm and beautiful and
the air cool, the bush began to thin a little, and the scent of
that funny stuff (she said) began to thin too.&nbsp; They were
approaching a well-defined ridge, and when they reached the crest
they saw that the bush on the farther slope was far thinner and
the trees bigger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just like an English park,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; And that is what they call Park Steppe in German
East.&nbsp; The slope in front of them shelved into a semicircle
of low hills beyond which an unbroken line of mountain stretched,
very solemn and placid in the evening air.&nbsp; A wide basin was
this country of the Waluguru, clogged in its deepest concavity
with dense blue forest and the brighter green of the
M&rsquo;ssente Swamp.&nbsp; Towards the ambient foothills, lips
of the basin, the Park Steppe rose on either hand: and these
lower hills were bare except for dark streaks of forest which
marked the courses of winter torrents.&nbsp; On the western rim,
part of which was already in shade, a white building shone in the
middle of the bare hill-side.&nbsp; That was the mission.</p>
<p>I have written that all these lesser hills were bare but
one.&nbsp; And this one, which was the highest of them all,
overhung the sources from which the M&rsquo;ssente river issued
into the dark forest.&nbsp; It seemed, indeed, as if some special
virtue in the moisture of the river&rsquo;s springs had tempted
the forest, whose vast body lay dark in the valley&rsquo;s
bottom, to swarm up its slopes and to clutch at the hill&rsquo;s
conical peak.&nbsp; But towards the top the trees abruptly ended,
and the volcanic form of the summit, the commonest of hill shapes
in East <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Africa, showed pale against the mountains behind.&nbsp;
On either side of this central peak the slopes of the hills were
cultivated and planted with rubber and coffee.&nbsp; The sight of
tilled earth and the homely green of the rubber-trees gave an
aspect of cheerfulness and civilisation to the valley which
helped one to forget the forest and swamps beneath.&nbsp; After
all, it seemed as if life at Luguru need not be as strange as
they had imagined.&nbsp; That night they encamped on the edge of
the basin.&nbsp; Another evening of brilliant starshine, until a
little later a crescent moon rose and hung above the peak of that
wooded hill.</p>
<p>Next day, though it was much farther than they had imagined,
they reached the mission.&nbsp; The place was sufficiently well
ordered, and reasonably clean.&nbsp; Although in the distance the
hill-side had seemed to be almost bare, they found that their
home was set about with a number of scattered trees, a kind of
croton, with slender twisted trunks and expanded crowns.&nbsp; By
daylight these trees carried their green heads so high in the
burning air that they gave no shade, and one was not conscious of
them; but when the evening descended on Luguru and their branches
stirred in a faint zodiacal glow they were most lovely
creatures.&nbsp; Every evening, at sundown, they would awake to
gracious life.&nbsp; Eva Burwarton grew to love them.&nbsp; All
the open ground about their little compound was scattered with
their fruit, which resembled that of the walnut.</p>
<p>By the side of the mission house lay the garden of which
Bullace had spoken, hedged with a <i>boma</i> of <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>sisal aloes,
many of which had flowered so that their tall poles rose up like
spears.&nbsp; Within the <i>boma</i> were untidy banana-trees
with their ragged leaves; a corner of guava and citrus; beds of
French beans and sweet potatoes over which a gourd had
straggled.&nbsp; It was a little garden, and Eva was sure that
soon she could reduce it to order.&nbsp; The prospect of doing so
pleased her.&nbsp; Such labour would be very sweet in the blue
evening when the croton-trees awakened.&nbsp; It was wonderful,
in a way, to be thrown upon one&rsquo;s own resources for every
comfort; and particularly in a country where nature did half the
work, where the ancient soil was rich with the death of
centuries, only waiting to give forth new life.&nbsp; Eva decided
that in a little while she would have a treasure of a
garden.&nbsp; But there were no flowers: that was the strange
thing about it&mdash;there were no flowers.</p>
<p>At the end of the garden most distant from the house and under
the spears of sisal stood a substantial <i>banda</i>, or hut,
built of grass closely thatched.&nbsp; A thin partition divided
this building into two chambers.&nbsp; In the outer a number of
gardening tools were stored.&nbsp; The inner and smaller of the
two was dark, the doorway of the partition being blocked with
loose boards, and Eva, looking through the cracks between the
boards, discovered that it was empty except for an immense pile
of empty whisky bottles in one corner.&nbsp; Her thoughts
returned quickly to her memory of Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s face, to
his hands that trembled with nervousness.&nbsp; She wondered. . .
.&nbsp; But her orderly mind soon realised that this inner room
might be <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>useful as a store for lumber, and that the outer, when
once it had been cleaned and swept, would make her a sort of
summer-house in which she might sit and read in the heat of the
day.&nbsp; There, she decided, she would take her sewing.&nbsp;
The <i>banda</i> should be devoted to her as the little arbour at
the bottom of the garden at Far Forest had been her chief
playground, the home of herself and her dolls, when she had been
a child.&nbsp; Living there, by herself, she would be a child
again.&nbsp; While she had this refuge James need never be
disturbed at his studies.&nbsp; It would be such fun . . .</p>
<p>Indeed it seemed to her in those days that their life at
Luguru must be almost idyllic, that they would live simply and at
peace, unvexed by troubles of body or mind.&nbsp; I think she was
naturally hopeful, and, if you like, ignorant.&nbsp; The idea of
tropical violence didn&rsquo;t enter into a mind fascinated with
tropical beauty.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t consider the menace of
disease.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t realise anything of the savage
life which struggled as it were to the surface in the depths of
the M&rsquo;ssente forests and the great swamp.&nbsp; She saw
only their own sunny hill-side, and the pleasant plantations of
Herr Godovius.&nbsp; Even when I came to know her she was only a
child . . .</p>
<p>During these first few days James showed himself eager to get
to work.&nbsp; As for the house and the garden and the little
<i>shamba</i> behind the mission, where coffee and mealies were
growing, he simply didn&rsquo;t seem to take them in.&nbsp; James
was all for souls&mdash;seriously . . . and the practical details
of life fell naturally to the lot of Eva.&nbsp; Goodness knows
what would <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>have happened to him if old Mr. Burwarton had not died
and released Eva to look after him.&nbsp; I suppose he would have
led a wild, prophetic sort of existence, depending for his
sustenance on locusts and wild honey (there were plenty of both)
or the ministrations of ravens . . . just until he discovered
that a man can&rsquo;t live on nothing.&nbsp; In a way it was a
misfortune that his physical wants were so completely provided
for by Eva&rsquo;s care; it gave him a chance of such complete
absorption in one idea as can be good for no man.&nbsp; In the
end it gave him time for brooding on his difficulties.&nbsp; Of
course, for all his fervour, he was exactly the wrong sort of man
for missionary work; but, as Eva herself admitted, he was built
for martyrdom.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t expect in those days how
literally he would get it.&nbsp; Win it, he would have said.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was not until their first Sunday, one of the great days, as
James said, of his life, that they met Godovius.&nbsp; He came to
the mission church. . . .&nbsp; Yes, Godovius came to church . .
.</p>
<p>A rather astonishing introduction.&nbsp; He galloped up on a
little Somali mule that somehow seemed to have got the better of
fly.&nbsp; A Waluguru boy had run all the way by his side.&nbsp;
When he handed over the mule to the boy, he stood waiting on the
edge of the kneeling assembly.&nbsp; The service was nearly over;
but he showed the least tinge of impatience at being kept
waiting.&nbsp; James was quite unconscious of this.&nbsp; At <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>home and on
the voyage he had been taught a very fair smattering of mission
Swahili, and the repetition of prayers in this exotic language by
the lips of forty or fifty converts led by the mission boys,
Hamisi the Luguru and Onyango, a stranger from the Wakamba
country with filed teeth, was an incense to him.&nbsp; This oasis
of prayer in the heart of an infidel desert . . .</p>
<p>But Eva, from the moment Godovius had ridden up, was conscious
of his physical presence, and even more, in an indefinite way, of
his spiritual immanence.&nbsp; He was, she reflected, their only
neighbour; and it struck her that James&rsquo; disregard of him,
a white man, was a shade impolite.&nbsp; Besides, she had only
just realised that the Luguru Christian, next to whom she knelt,
exhaled a distinct and highly unpleasant odour.&nbsp; Of course
that wasn&rsquo;t his fault, poor thing . . . but still . .
.&nbsp; She noticed, too, that James was the only person in all
that assembly who didn&rsquo;t realise Godovius&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; The natives on either side of her gave a little
movement which might have meant anything when he
approached.&nbsp; She even heard one of them murmur a word . . .
something like <i>Saccharine</i> . . . and wondered what it
meant.&nbsp; Although they still muttered the formula which they
had learned, Eva was certain that they were really thinking a
great deal more of the dark man who stood waiting behind
them.&nbsp; It was a funny impression; and the intuition vanished
as quickly as it had come to her; for James finished his service,
the crowd drifted away, and Godovius himself came forward with an
altogether <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>charming smile.&nbsp; He spoke English well: with more
purity, indeed, than either of them.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;Mr.
Burwarton? . . . I was told your name by the good Bullace.&nbsp;
I am your neighbour . . .&nbsp; Godovius.&nbsp; We must be
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand: James grasped it and shook it
fervently.</p>
<p>He bowed to Eva.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your wife?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish of me . . .&nbsp; I should have
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how Eva saw him: Tall, certainly taller than James,
who himself was above middle height.&nbsp; And dark . . . perhaps
that was only to be expected from the sun of those parts; but she
had always imagined that Germans were fair.&nbsp; In no way did
he answer to her ideas of Germanity.&nbsp; He was exceedingly
polite: after all, she supposed most foreigners were that: but to
the exotic grace which was the traditional birthright of
Continentals there was here added strength.&nbsp; She had never
met a man who gave such an impression of smooth capability.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He looked clever,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t
seem ever to have struck her that Godovius was a Jew, even though
she quickly decided that he wasn&rsquo;t typically German.&nbsp;
Indefinitely she had been prejudiced against him; but now that
she saw him she liked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t help
liking him.&nbsp; He was really very handsome.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
only thing about which she wasn&rsquo;t quite sure was his
eyes.&nbsp; They were dark . . . very dark: &ldquo;Not the soft
sort of dark,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>They all moved towards the mission house, Eva <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>first,
Godovius and her brother walking side by side.&nbsp; They were
already talking of the Waluguru.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find them easy,&rdquo; Godovius
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I may safely say that I know more
about them than anyone else.&nbsp; No other settler has a
<i>shamba</i> in their country.&nbsp; And it isn&rsquo;t a big
country, although they&rsquo;re a fairly numerous tribe.&nbsp;
Down there&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed with the long thong of hippo
hide which he carried as a whip to the dark forest beneath them,
bloomed with quivering air&mdash;&ldquo;down there, under the
leaves, they live thickly.&nbsp; The life in that forest . . .
human . . . sub-human . . . because they aren&rsquo;t all like
men . . . the apes: and then, right away down in the scale, the
great pythons.&nbsp; Oh . . . the leeches in the pools.&nbsp;
Life . . . all seething up under the tree-tops, with different
degrees of aspirations, ideals.&nbsp; Life, like a great flower
pushing in the sun . . .&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James said yes, it was.&nbsp; He reined back Godovius to the
business in hand: <i>his</i> business.&nbsp; Why, he asked, were
the Waluguru difficult?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; But the matter was
ethnological.&nbsp; Mr. Burwarton was a student of ethnology?</p>
<p>James wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Godovius was quick with offers of help.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a habit with me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can lend you books if you wish them.&nbsp; Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t read German?&nbsp; Ah . . . all the best ethnology is
German.&nbsp; But I have some English.&nbsp; Frazer . . . <i>The
Golden Bough</i>.&nbsp; No doubt you have read that . . . if
religion interests you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>James
couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him understand what these things
had to do with the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; To him religion was
such a simple thing.&nbsp; And all the time Eva was listening,
not because she understood what Godovius was talking about, but
because she was conscious of the suppressed flame in him: just
because, in fact, he interested her.</p>
<p>He came back to the Waluguru.&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t, he
said, a pure Bantu stock by any means.&nbsp; There were elements
of a very different kind.&nbsp; Semitic.&nbsp; Of course there
was any amount of Arab blood among the coastal Swahili; but the
case of the Waluguru was rather peculiar: the way in which they
were isolated by the lie of the land&mdash;the Mountains of the
Moon to the north, the thick bush on the south.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d developed more or less on irregular lines.&nbsp;
Nobody knew how they&rsquo;d got there.&nbsp; Physically they
were very attractive . . . the women at any rate.</p>
<p>But none of these things would necessarily make them
&ldquo;difficult,&rdquo; James protested.</p>
<p>Godovius smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, perhaps not . . .&nbsp; At
any rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find my people
interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp; He called them <i>my people</i>.</p>
<p>Eva noticed that: she always noticed little things, and
remembered at the same time the way in which the Waluguru
congregation had responded to his presence in the middle of
James&rsquo;s prayers; but this impression was soon covered by
her appreciation of the fact that he was talking all the time to
her as much as to James: and that was for her an unusual
sensation, for she had been accustomed for long enough to <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>taking a back
seat when James was present.&nbsp; This attitude of Godovius
subtly flattered her, and she began to feel, rather guiltily,
that she had allowed a first impression to influence her
unfairly.&nbsp; She became less awkward, permitting herself to
realise that their neighbour was really very good-looking in a
dark, sanguine, aggressively physical way.&nbsp; She noticed his
teeth, which were white&mdash;very white and regular as the teeth
of an animal or of an African native: and then, suddenly, once
again she noticed his eyes, deep brown and very lustrous.&nbsp;
He was looking at her carefully; he was looking at her all over,
and though she wasn&rsquo;t conscious of any expression in them
which could allow her to guess what he was thinking, she
blushed.&nbsp; It annoyed her that she should have blushed, for
she felt the wave spreading over her neck and chest and knew that
he must realise that she was blushing all over.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
felt as if I weren&rsquo;t properly clothed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then Godovius smiled.&nbsp; He took it all for granted.&nbsp;
He spoke to her just as if James had not been there: as if they
had been standing alone on the stoep with nothing but the silence
of Africa around them.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realise that my eyes haven&rsquo;t rested on a
white woman for more than five years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
Why on earth should she have said that she was sorry?</p>
<p>That morning he spoke no more to her.&nbsp; He stood on the
stoep, a little impatiently, slapping his leggings with his
<i>kiboko</i>, and answering the anxious questions <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of James as
if he had set himself a task and meant to go through with
it.&nbsp; Eva, watching them, realised that if she were sorry, as
she had said, for Godovius, she had much more reason to be sorry
for James.&nbsp; The physical contrast between the two men was
borne in on her so strangely.&nbsp; And a little later, feeling
that she wasn&rsquo;t really wanted, she slipped into the
house.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>James and she discussed this surprising visit over their
evening meal.&nbsp; They were sitting, as usual, upon the wide
stoep which overlooked the valley and the forest and all that
cavernous vista which the plantations of Godovius and the conical
hill named Kilima ja Mweze dominated.&nbsp; James was rather
tired with his day&rsquo;s work&mdash;the enthusiasm of the
Sabbath always consumed him and left him weak and mildly
excited&mdash;and it was with a sense of sweet relief that they
watched the croton-trees stirring in an air that was no longer
eaten out with light.&nbsp; They ate sparingly of a paw-paw which
Hamisi had cut from the clusters in the garden, and Eva had
picked a rough green lemon from one of her own trees that stood
decked with such pale lamps of fruit in the evening light.&nbsp;
Then they had coffee made from the berries which Mr. Bullace had
left behind: Mocha coffee grown in the plantations of
Godovius.</p>
<p>James sipped his coffee and then said suddenly: &ldquo;Do you
like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Eva
knew whom he meant perfectly well, but found herself asking:
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Godovius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think he is a good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp; I think he is a good man.&nbsp; Here
we cannot judge by the same standards as at home.&nbsp; Settlers
live very isolated lives . . . far away from any Christian
influences, and I think that very often they don&rsquo;t look
with favour on missionary work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been told so. .
. .&nbsp; One is fortunate to find them even&mdash;how can I put
it?&mdash;neutral.&nbsp; He that is not against us is for
us.&nbsp; He was kind, extremely kind.&nbsp; And then we have Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you trust Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s word?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t trust our own people . . .&rdquo; he
began; but she was sorry for what she had said, and hastened to
tell him that she didn&rsquo;t mean it, and that she really
thought Godovius had been quite kind and neighbourly to have
visited them so soon, and that, no doubt, he knew more about the
Waluguru than anyone else and might be a great help to them.</p>
<p>He was only too happy to agree with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you
left us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he offered to help you with the
garden, to explain to you all the things of which you probably
wouldn&rsquo;t know the uses.&nbsp; Oh, he was most kind.&nbsp;
And why did you run away from us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not tell him the real reason, principally because
she did not know.&nbsp; But that was always the peculiar thing
about her relation with Godovius: from the first an amazing
mixture of repulsion and . . . something <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>else to which
she found it impossible to give a name.</p>
<p>That night when she had gone to bed, leaving James a lonely
figure in the pale circle of light which his reading-lamp
reclaimed from the enveloping darkness, she found herself
curiously restless and disturbed.&nbsp; It was perhaps in part
that she was still unused to the peculiar character of the
African night, that tingling darkness in which so much minute
life stirs in the booming and whiffling of uncounted wings, in
the restless movements of so many awakening tendrils and
leaves.&nbsp; This was a darkness in which there was no
peace.&nbsp; But it was not only that.&nbsp; Godovius troubled
her.&nbsp; The picture of him which abode with her that night was
so different from that of reassurance in which he had left
them.&nbsp; Now she could only be conscious of his sinister side;
and the impression assailed her with such an overwhelming force
that she wondered how in the world she could have been led into
such a feeble acquiescence with James, who thought evil of no
man, on the subject of their neighbour.&nbsp; For now, if she
confessed the truth to herself, she was frightened of
Godovius.&nbsp; She was convinced, too, that Mr. Bullace had lied
to them.&nbsp; She conceived it her duty to tell James so.&nbsp;
And thus, half sleeping or half awake, she found herself in the
passage of the bungalow at the door of the room in which she had
left her brother reading.&nbsp; He was not there.&nbsp; The
vacant room lay steeped in moonlight of an amazing brilliance;
she could read the sermon of Spurgeon which lay open on the
table.&nbsp; It took her a few <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>seconds to realise that the impulse
which had forced her to set out upon this errand of
disillusionment had come to her in sleep, flying into her
consciousness like a dark moth out of the restless night: but for
all that she could not at once persuade herself that she had been
foolish, not indeed until she realised that her feet were cold
upon the floor and that she had better beware of snakes and
jiggers and other terrors of the earth.&nbsp; If she had been
wearing slippers she would probably have wakened James.&nbsp; As
it was, defenceless and bewildered, she moved out of the cold
moonlight back to her room, where she fell into an uneasy
sleep.&nbsp; For now, more than ever, she was conscious of the
night&rsquo;s noises and a little later of one noise which
resembled the fluttered beating of her own heart as she listened:
the monotonous pulsations, somewhere down in the white mist of
the forest, of an African drum.</p>

36</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day when she woke she had
forgotten all about her questionings.&nbsp; It was one of the
peerless mornings of that hill country in which the very air,
faintly chilled by night, possesses a golden quality, which gives
it the effect of sunny autumn days in Europe.&nbsp; Only once did
she remember the shadow of her premonitions, and that was when
she came singing into the room which she had last seen in the
moonlight and found upon the table the book of Spurgeon&rsquo;s
sermons open at the same page.&nbsp; But in this new and
delightful atmosphere Eva could afford to laugh at her
fancies.&nbsp; There were so many pleasant things to be done, and
as the sun rose that vast, smiling country unfolded around her
with a suggestion of spaciousness and warmth and leisure.&nbsp; A
land of infinite promise in which the very simplicity of
life&rsquo;s demands should make one immune from the menace of
discontent: where, for a little labour, the rich soil should give
great recompense.&nbsp; Indeed it seemed to her that in this
place she might be very happy, for she asked very little of
life.</p>
<p>Her first concern was Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>, and
the tangled garden which seemed as though it had been long
deserted and overgrown, although it had only <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>been cumbered
with the fierce growth of one season&rsquo;s rains.&nbsp; Here,
in the golden morning, she would get to work with the two boys,
Hamisi and Onyango, watching their happy, leisurely manner of
husbandry.&nbsp; They worked until their black limbs were stained
with warm red earth, and sometimes while they were toiling they
would sing to each other strange antiphonal airs which made their
labour seem like some delightful game of childhood.&nbsp; It was
good to watch them at work, for they seemed so happy and human
and unvexed by any of the preoccupations of the civilised
man.&nbsp; Indeed it was very difficult to realise that they were
really savages, and it came as a shock to her one day when she
saw Hamisi, the M&rsquo;kamba, with his splendid torso stripped,
and noticed upon his chest the pattern of scars which the
medicine-man had carved upon his living flesh in some barbaric
rite.&nbsp; She grew fascinated with their patience and good
nature and their splendid white teeth: and after a little while
she was no longer distressed by their obvious laziness, for in
the placid life of Luguru there was no conceivable need for
hurry.&nbsp; She even went to the trouble of borrowing a green
vocabulary from James&rsquo; shelf and learning a few words of
everyday Swahili which she would use with intense
satisfaction.&nbsp; There was a new pleasure and a sense of power
in the speaking of a strange tongue which she had never known
before.&nbsp; When she spoke to the boys in Swahili they smiled
at her: but this did not mean that they were amused at her
flounderings: they were of a people that smiled at all things,
even at suffering and at death.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>One
morning when they were working thus, and she sat watching them in
the door of Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>, she was startled to
hear them stop in the middle of one of their songs.&nbsp; With a
sudden sense of some new presence she turned round, and found
that Godovius was standing near her in the path.&nbsp; He raised
his hat to her and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to come and help you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And here I am . . . quite at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange that in this meeting not one of her old doubts
returned.&nbsp; His arrival had been too sudden to leave her time
to think, and now, instinctively, she liked him.&nbsp; He seemed
so thoroughly at ease himself that a strained attitude on her
part was impossible: and in a very little time he convinced her
that he was actually as good as his word and that his knowledge
would be of great use to her.&nbsp; They walked round the garden
together, and he told her the names of many things which she had
not known, while he instructed her in the cooking of many strange
delicacies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these boys of yours aren&rsquo;t working
properly,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can get a great deal
more out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I get quite enough,&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, I believe I rather like their way of work.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s . . . well, it&rsquo;s restful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, Miss
Burwarton; but it&rsquo;s bad for them . . . very bad for
them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only one way of managing natives.&nbsp;
I expect you&rsquo;d think it a very brutal way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
a <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>great
believer in the <i>kiboko</i>.&nbsp; You can only get at an
African through his skin.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very thick skin, you
know.&nbsp; Nothing is so terrible as physical pain.&nbsp; But
then . . . nothing is so quickly forgotten.&nbsp; On a mind of
this kind . . . if you like to call it a mind . . . the
impression fades very quickly.&nbsp; Fear . . . that is the only
way in which we small communities of Europeans can rule these
black millions.&nbsp; By fear. . . .&nbsp; It sounds cruel: but
when you come to think of it that is the way in which your
missionaries teach them Christian morals, by frightening them
with threats of what will happen if they don&rsquo;t embrace
them.&nbsp; I know that the good Bullace rather specialised in
hell.&nbsp; But what is an indefinite hell compared with definite
physical pain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t fully understand what he was driving
at.&nbsp; Life had never accustomed her to deal with
abstractions; but he saw that she was puzzled and perhaps a
little frightened.</p>
<p>So he stuck the <i>kiboko</i>, which he had been flourishing
as he spoke, under his arm and smiled at her in a way that was
almost boyish.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like what I
say?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well then.&nbsp; I will
show you.&nbsp; We will apply the other kind of persuasion.&nbsp;
So . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still smiling, he called to the two Africans.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kimbia . . .&nbsp; Run!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; They stood
before him, and he spoke to them in swift, guttural
Swahili.&nbsp; The foreigner from the Wakamba country stared at
him dully; but the Waluguru boy, Hamisi, cowered beneath his
words as though a storm were breaking over <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>him.&nbsp; He
fell to his knees, covering his head with his hands and shaking
violently in every muscle, almost as if he were in the cold stage
of an attack of fever.&nbsp; When Godovius stopped speaking the
boy still trembled.&nbsp; Onyango, the M&rsquo;kamba, turned and
went sullenly back to his work, Godovius pushed the other with
his foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get up . . . quenda,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
Then Hamisi staggered on to his legs.&nbsp; He rubbed his eyes,
those brown-veined African eyes blotched with pigment, as though
he wanted to obliterate some hallucinated vision, and Eva saw
that they weren&rsquo;t like human eyes at all, but like those of
an animal full of terror.&nbsp; Again Godovius told him to go,
and he murmured, &ldquo;N&rsquo;dio Sakharani,&rdquo; and
stumbled away.</p>
<p><i>Sakharani</i>. . . .&nbsp; Eva remembered the whisper which
had spread through the Waluguru congregation on the morning when
Godovius had ridden up on his little Somali mule.&nbsp; She was
startled and at the same time instinctively anxious to appear
self-possessed.&nbsp; She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakharani. . . .&nbsp; Is that a name that they give
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, of course.&nbsp; They are funny
people.&nbsp; They always invent names for us.&nbsp; I expect
they have given you one already.&nbsp; They are generally
descriptive names, and pretty accurately descriptive,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what does &lsquo;Sakharani&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are making things
very awkward for me.&nbsp; But I will tell you.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sakharani&rsquo; means &lsquo;drunken.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>All
this he said very solemnly, and Eva, taking the matter with a
simple seriousness, looked him up and down with her big eyes, so
that he burst out laughing, slapping his leggings in that most
familiar gesture with his whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are shocked. . . .&nbsp; Of course you are
shocked.&nbsp; You think I am a drunkard, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him truthfully that he didn&rsquo;t look like one;
for the skin of his face beneath the shade of the double terai
hat of greyish felt was wonderfully clear, and those strange eyes
of his were clear also: besides this, she could see that he was
still intrigued by the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that I am one who is drunk with whisky like
your reverend friend Mr. Bullace.&nbsp; No . . . you&rsquo;re
mistaken.&nbsp; You English people have only one idea of being
drunk&mdash;with your whisky.&nbsp; But there are other
ways.&nbsp; You do not know what it is to be drunk with the glory
of power&mdash;was not Alexander drunk?&mdash;or to be drunk with
beauty . . . you have no music . . . or to be drunk, divinely
drunk, with love, with passion.&nbsp; Ah . . . now do you know
what &lsquo;Sakharani&rsquo; means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather disconcerted by this outburst, for she had never heard
anything of this kind in Far Forest, she told him that she
thought she knew what he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; What can an Englishwoman know of
passion?&nbsp; Nonsense! . . .&nbsp; Of course you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, seeing her bewilderment, his
manner suddenly changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forgive me my . . . my fit
of drunkenness,&rdquo; he <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is much better
that you should be as you are.&nbsp; You are beautifully
simple.&nbsp; A woman of your simplicity is capable of all.&nbsp;
Forgive me . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this he left her feeling almost dazed in the sunny
garden, in the fainting heat of the tropical midday in which all
things seem to be asleep or in a state of suspended life.&nbsp;
When he had gone the whole of that land around seemed uncannily
still, there was no sound in it but the melancholy note of
hornbills calling to one another in dry recesses of the
thorn-bush, and it seemed to her that even their voices drooped
with heat . . .</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>That evening a Waluguru boy came over from Njumba ja Mweze
with a great basket of strange flowers, great orchids horned and
blotched with savage colour.&nbsp; When she took them out of the
basket and placed them straggling in a wide bowl upon the table
in their living-room she was almost afraid of them, for their
splendour seemed to mock the meanness of the little house almost
as if the forest itself with all its untamed life had invaded
their quietude, asserting beyond question its primeval,
passionate strength.&nbsp; Before she had finished arranging them
James came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like them?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He fingered the fleshy petals of a great orange flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are marvellous,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
this hidden <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>beauty of creation. . . .&nbsp; Where did you get
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get them.&nbsp; Mr. Godovius sent
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of him to think of us,&rdquo; he said; but
his face fell, and she knew that he was suddenly questioning the
propriety of the gift, suspecting in spite of his own words that
they had been sent to her and yet ashamed of his suspicions. She
knew James so well.</p>
<p>But she did not show him the card she found in the bottom of
the basket, which was written in a pointed, foreign hand with
many flourishes, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have forgiven me?&nbsp; For you they should have
been violets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that evening the presence of these flowers worried
her.&nbsp; It seemed to her as if Godovius himself were in the
room, as if those extravagant blooms were an expression of his
sanguine, sinister personality: and when James, who was tired
with a long day of tramping in the heat, had gone to bed, a
strange impulse made her want to take the fleshy flowers and
crush their petals to a pulp.&nbsp; She hated them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to crush them,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;they would be wet and nasty and bleed, as if they were
alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so she left them where they were.</p>
<p>But he sent many other flowers, and several times he came
himself, nearly always in that hour of the level sunlight.&nbsp;
He would come into the garden and stand over her, saying little,
but all the time watching her from beneath his grey slouch
hat.&nbsp; In all these days he never returned to the subject of
the name the natives had given him or allowed himself <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to be led
into such another outburst of passion.&nbsp; Instead of this, he
nearly always talked to her of herself, subtly, and with a very
winning friendliness, inducing her to do the same.&nbsp; He had
been in England a good deal, it appeared; but there was nothing
remarkable in that, since he had been everywhere.&nbsp; And yet
even so, they had little in common; for the England which he knew
was nothing more than the West End of London, with which he
assumed an impressive familiarity and which she did not know at
all.&nbsp; It did not seem to have occurred to him that there was
any other England, and he listened with a sort of amused
tolerance to her stories of Far Forest and those Shropshire days
now so incredibly remote.&nbsp; Of these things she would talk
happily enough, for to speak of them mitigated without her
knowledge a home-sickness to which she would not have
confessed.&nbsp; The remembrance of many green days in that
country of springing rivers had the power of soothing her almost
as gently as the music of their streams, so that speaking of her
love of them she would forget for a moment all that vast basin of
Luguru.&nbsp; And then, no doubt, that look of tender wistfulness
which I myself had seen would steal into her eyes, giving them an
aspect peculiarly soft and . . . vernal: there is no other
word.&nbsp; It was not strange that Godovius, caressing her ideal
innocence, should have told her that her voice was soft when she
spoke of her home.&nbsp; And this frightened her.&nbsp; Why
should he have noticed her voice?&nbsp; She became, with an
alarming suddenness, stiff and awkward and unnatural: which <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>made Godovius
smile, for he saw that he had read her very thoroughly and that
the workings of her mind were plain to him.&nbsp; It amused him
to see the adorable shyness with which she shut the opened doors
of her heart and flattered him that he should have guessed the
way in which they might be opened without her knowing it.&nbsp;
She was scared; but it was very certain that however she felt
towards him, and however she might have been repelled by sudden
glimpses of his strange personality, she could not deny that he
had been kind.</p>
<p>One day it happened that she disclosed to him that her name
was Eva.&nbsp; &ldquo;A beautiful name,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and one that perfectly suits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked him &ldquo;Why&rdquo;: and in reply he told her, as
one might tell a child, the story of the Meister-singers, of the
love of the handsome Walther for her namesake in the opera, and
of the noble resignation of Hans Sachs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like the music of Eva,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She smiled at him: for it seemed to her ridiculous that music
of any kind could be like a living woman.&nbsp; Indeed she
thought him rather silly, and extravagant as usual, and was
amazed to see the seriousness with which he proceeded to explain
what seemed to her a very ordinary story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will come to my
house and I will play to you some Wagner, and then you will see
for yourself that I am right.&nbsp; Of course music is not
natural to the English . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this he would often ask her: &ldquo;When are <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>you coming to
see me . . . you and your brother?&rdquo; so often that at last
she was compelled to ask James when he would take her.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>But for all that she did not visit the House of the Moon for
many weeks.&nbsp; James could not find time to go there with
her.&nbsp; With an almost desperate enthusiasm he had thrown
himself into the task of Christianising the Waluguru.&nbsp; He
could not treat the business in a measured, leisurely way.&nbsp;
Every morning Eva would watch him setting out from the stoep over
the scattered park-land which sloped to the forest and the great
swamp, a bizarre, pathetic figure, threading his way between the
flat-topped acacias.&nbsp; In a little while the thin shapes of
innumerable trees would close around him and for the rest of that
day he would be lost to her, for he always carried a small parcel
of food and a water-bottle with him into the forest.&nbsp; Just
about the time of their sudden sunset he would return, in the
hour when the fine noises of night begin: and then he would fling
himself down, tired out, on the lounge-chair in their little
room, with his feet on the long wooden foot-rest stained with the
intersecting circles of Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s glasses.&nbsp; When
he came home at night he was always exhausted, sometimes too
tired even to eat, and Eva, who felt unhappy about him, would try
to persuade him to take things more easily.&nbsp; She knew as
well as he did that it was not usual for Europeans to work
themselves <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>to death in the neighbourhood of the Equator: she had
seen for herself the man&rsquo;s stormy, precarious childhood and
knew how delicate he was.&nbsp; When he had been working at
&ldquo;college&rdquo; a nervous breakdown had thrown him back on
Far Forest for four months, and she felt that soon something of
the same kind must happen here.&nbsp; But it was useless to argue
with James.&nbsp; She realised that from the beginning.&nbsp; In
the Burwarton family his distinguished vocation had always made
him a law to himself; her part in his career had been limited to
respectful admiration, and it was impossible that their change of
surroundings should alter the relation.&nbsp; Whatever she might
say, James believed he knew best: and there was an end of the
matter.</p>
<p>It is difficult to visualise the kind of life which James was
leading amongst his Waluguru.&nbsp; Entering the forest by one of
those tawny paths of sand which trickled down to it from the dry
bush, he must have passed into the still outer zone of their
retreat, moving through the green gloom far beneath the crowns of
those enormous trees like some creature struggling among thickets
of seaweed in the depths of the sea.&nbsp; In these profundities
no sound disturbed the heavy air: the trailing tangles of liana
never stirred, and into their gloom there penetrated none of the
fragrance and light and colour which trembled in an ecstasy of
sunlight above the roofs of those green mansions.&nbsp; Not
easily did one attain to the haunts of the Waluguru.&nbsp; Two
stinking creeks were to be crossed by the trunks of forest trees
which had <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>been felled by fire&mdash;the only bridges the Waluguru
know&mdash;and next a reach of dazzling river, where the forest
fell away and sunlight burst through with the pride of a
conqueror, flashing back from the smooth sheets of yellow
water.&nbsp; Then one came to a zone in which tree trunks had
been felled on every side, where often a smouldering fire might
be seen in the heart of a doomed but living tree: and in the
spaces between the Waluguru had planted vast groves of the
plantains on which they live: for they are a forest people, and
the maize which feeds so great a part of Africa will not flourish
in the dank air which they breathe.&nbsp; Between the groups of
plantains they had dug pits in that black soil which is nothing
but the mould of green things which had thriven and died and
rotted in the same gloom, and in the bottom of these pits lies
the black water of the M&rsquo;ssente Swamp, breeding the fever
of which many of them die.</p>
<p>Serpentine paths trodden in the oozy earth by the flocks of
goats which the Waluguru tend threaded these groves: and by
following one of them James was certain to arrive at a little
clearing in the forest and a group of huts with pointed roofs of
reeds.&nbsp; These oases, miserable, and sunless, were the field
of his labours.&nbsp; In them he would find a number of women
decked in rings of copper wire and small pot-bellied children who
stared with open mouths.&nbsp; The men he would seldom see, for
all of them who could stagger beneath a load were toiling as
slaves in the airy plantations of Godovius, wearing for the
symbol of their servitude a disk of zinc on which a <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>number and
the brand of their master, the crescent moon, were stamped.&nbsp;
On the whole, I imagine that theirs was a far happier existence
than that of the women who languished in the great swamp.&nbsp;
They, at any rate, might sometimes see the sun, even if the
sunlight were cruel.&nbsp; Most of the women seemed to James to
be very old; but it was impossible for him to guess at their real
age, and they could not tell him, for lengths of years is not a
thing to be treasured among the Waluguru.&nbsp; It is probable
that none of them were really aged, but only emaciated by labour
and poor feeding and disease.&nbsp; Nor were there many
children.&nbsp; The Waluguru know well enough that it is a
tragedy to be born.&nbsp; Most of the small creatures which he
saw lolling their great heads were scabbed with yaws and
tragically thin.&nbsp; An atmosphere of hopelessness descended on
him as soon as he set foot within their clearings.&nbsp; It
seemed to him that in these sinister recesses some devil had been
at work trying malignantly to stamp out the least flicker of
humanity in the souls or bodies of these people, and beneath this
intangible menace he was powerless.&nbsp; There was no more hope
for these creatures than for any pale weed struggling to catch a
glimpse of light in the bottom of one of their black pits.&nbsp;
Everywhere the swarming green stole from them the life of the
air: and when they still struggled miraculously upward a winged
death, whining in the dank air, must sow their blood with other
hungry parasites.&nbsp; It was all hopeless . . . hopeless.&nbsp;
It would have been better, he was sometimes tempted to think, if
a great fire should consume <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>all this damnable green, a purging
fire that should sweeten where it destroyed, and give the ashes
of humanity a chance to make a new start.&nbsp; But even if his
wish had not been impious, he knew that its fulfilment was
impossible: for he remembered the living trees in whose heart a
dull fire smouldered, just as the fire of fever smouldered in
these people&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>It was necessary to make a beginning: and so James set himself
to learn the language, Kiluguru; and this he rejoiced to find
less difficult than he supposed, for the tongue was scattered
very thickly with Arabic words, more thickly even than the
coastal Kiswahili.&nbsp; To these were added the Bantu inflective
prefixes with which he was already fairly familiar.&nbsp; The
consciousness that in this he was gradually drawing nearer to
these people cheered him, although he knew that even when he had
made himself master of their speech he must find himself faced
with the merest outposts of the enemy.&nbsp; And so with an
aching heart he settled down to the first steps of a most
exhausting campaign.&nbsp; No man with a small or faltering faith
could have faced it; but there was never any doubt but that James
was of the stuff of which heroes, and martyrs, are made.</p>
<p>All day he moved among the people of Godovius, and little by
little he began to think that he was getting nearer to
them.&nbsp; Their squalor, their loathly diseases, the very
grotesqueness with which their faces were modelled&mdash;things
which in the beginning had filled him with bewilderment rather
than distaste&mdash;became so familiar that he thought no more of
them.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>They were so near to the beasts that any token of
humanity smiled suddenly at him with the effect of a
miracle.&nbsp; He was even surprised into finding strange
revelations of beauty . . . beauty . . . no less . . . in their
black masks.&nbsp; In the gloom of the evening, when the sun
which bathed the hills in amber light could no longer penetrate
the thick curtains of the forest, when the thin song of
innumerable mosquitoes thrilled the air and the liquid trilling
of frogs arose from every creek and cranny of the swamp, he would
leave them and set out for the mission with a sense of exaltation
in the work accomplished and horrors overpast.&nbsp; The mere
physical relief of emerging into the open air of the thin bush,
scattered with slades of waving grasses in which herds of game
were grazing, coloured his mood.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, he
would be so overwhelmed with their poignant contrast that he
would ask himself whether after all it wasn&rsquo;t his duty to
leave the mission and live altogether with the Waluguru, and
wonder why he, any more than they, should be entitled to the
luxury of light.&nbsp; For the most part he was too richly
contented to consider his own fatigue: but once or twice, in the
midst of this bland mood, he found himself arrested and thrown
back upon despair by a sudden sound which mocked him from the
recesses of the swamp behind him.&nbsp; This was the sound which
had troubled Eva on the night which she had visited his moonlit
study: the rhythmical beating of a drum.&nbsp; It seemed to him
not merely a mysterious symbol of some darkness to which he had
not penetrated, but rather malignant and <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>challenging.&nbsp; He realised that there was more in
the forest than he had bargained for; that he was opposed to
powers of whose existence and strength he was ignorant.&nbsp; An
imaginative man, it seemed to him that these distant, insistent
pulsations were like the beating heart of the forest, an
expression of its immense and savage life.&nbsp; When he heard it
he would do the simple thing which seemed most natural to
him.&nbsp; There, in the tawny sand of the bush path, he would
kneel down and pray; and later, comforted in some mysterious
manner, he would move on his way.</p>

53</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> came a day of cruel,
intolerable heat.&nbsp; All the morning Eva lay in a long chair
within the shade of the <i>banda</i> in the garden under the
sisal hedge.&nbsp; There was no sun, but the light which beat
down from the white-hot sky seemed somehow less bearable than
sunlight.&nbsp; Little by little she had realised her idea of
turning this grass hut into a sanctuary for herself, and though
the thatching of the reeds gave her less protection from the sky
than the roof of the house would have done, she was so far in
love with this privacy that she preferred to lie there.&nbsp; Its
shelter defied the heavy dews which settle in the night: and she
had made the place homely with a couple of chairs and a table on
which her work-basket stood.&nbsp; There was even a little
bookshelf crammed with the paper novels which Mr. Bullace had
left behind him and others which Godovius had sent down for her
to read.&nbsp; But the day was far too hot for reading: the mere
unconscious strain of living was enough.&nbsp; That morning after
James had left her she had begun to write a letter in pencil to
her aunt at Pensax, a village hidden in the valleys beyond Far
Forest, and when she laid it aside she had fallen asleep in her
chair and dreamed that she was back <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>again in that distant March, walking
through meadows that were vinous with the scent of
cowslips.&nbsp; It was a pleasant day, with skies of a cool blue
and fleets of white cloud sailing slowly out of Wales, a day on
which one might walk through the green ways of the forest until
one reached Severn-side above the floating bridge at Arley.&nbsp;
This pleasant dream cooled her fancy.&nbsp; When she awoke it was
afternoon and hotter than ever, and the awakening was less real
than her dream.&nbsp; In the midst of the garden Hamisi and
Onyango sprawled asleep in the full sunlight with bent arms
sheltering their eyes.&nbsp; She wondered why they did not lie in
the shade of the row of flamboyant acacias farther back.&nbsp;
Now they were bursting into blood-red bloom, very bright against
their rich feathery leaves.&nbsp; Beyond them the mission glared
in the sun.&nbsp; A great bougainvillea had oversprawled the
white corner of the house in a cascade of magenta blossom.&nbsp;
It was all rather fantastically lovely, so lovely that she
couldn&rsquo;t help feeling she ought to be happy.&nbsp; But she
was too hot to be happy. . . .&nbsp; Even the voices of the
hornbills calling in the bush drooped with heat.</p>
<p>That evening when James came home from the forest he would
take no supper.&nbsp; She tried to coax him; but soon discovered
that he was irritable and depressed.&nbsp; Even now, at sunset,
the air trembled with heat.&nbsp; She said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been a dreadful day. . . .&nbsp; I expect the heat has been too
much for you.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t take enough care of
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heat? . . .&nbsp; What are you talking about?&rdquo; he
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really rather chilly .
. . quite chilly for Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course it was no good arguing with James, so she left him
sitting at his table with an open Bible before him.&nbsp; She
went into the kitchen and busied herself with the distasteful job
of washing her own dirty plates.&nbsp; On a day like this it was
hardly worth while eating if the process implied such a laborious
consequence.&nbsp; When she came back to the living-room,
intending to finish her Pensax letter, she found her brother
swathed in a blanket which he had fetched from his own bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever is the matter with you?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you it was chilly . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you must be ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flared up in a way that was quite unusual for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill? . . .&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Eva. . .
.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m never ill.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t time to be
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a few minutes later he fell a-shivering, shaking horribly
within his blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there is something the matter with me,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be fever.&nbsp; It
can&rsquo;t possibly be fever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never missed
taking my quinine, and you never get fever if you take
quinine.&nbsp; My head aches.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d better go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stalked off to his room, a pitifully fantastic figure in
his blanket.&nbsp; Eva brought him some hot milk.&nbsp; He
complained that it tasted bitter, of the gourd, but she made him
swallow it.&nbsp; Then she took his <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>temperature and found that it was a
hundred and four.&nbsp; The thermometer chattered between his
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is fever,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>All that night she stayed near his bedside.&nbsp; James was
not a pleasant patient.&nbsp; Even now he wanted all the time to
make it clear that his illness was his own affair and that he was
competent to deal with it.&nbsp; Now the blanket was too much for
him.&nbsp; He wanted to throw off all the clothes and lie in his
cotton nightshirt.&nbsp; His head still ached, but he was excited
and talkative and would not let her sleep.&nbsp; His brain
seethed with excitement and for the first time since they had
been at Luguru he began to talk to her about his work under the
leaves.&nbsp; He told her many things which seemed to her
horrible: so horrible that she could hardly believe that they
were anything more than imaginations of his enhavocked brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see what we are fighting against,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s only the beginning . . . it&rsquo;s
only the beginning.&nbsp; God give me strength to finish it, to
go through with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the night he prayed aloud.</p>
<p>That night there was no sleep for either of them.&nbsp; Eva
lay wakeful on the stretcher bed in his room, listening now to
the wandering talk of James and now to the howling of the hyenas
over on the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>At half-past five in the morning, when the first light came,
he pulled himself together.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right
now,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a big day in front
of me.&nbsp; Will you help me to get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>She
thought it best to let him try.&nbsp; When he got on to his feet
he swayed and clutched at the bed to steady himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everything swims . . . the whole room went round even when
I shut my eyes.&nbsp; I must be ill.&nbsp; What can I do? . .
.&nbsp; What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thankful that he had proved it for himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is where I come in,&rdquo; she thought, convinced
that she was going to have a bad time of it.</p>
<p>For four days James kept his bed; as long, indeed, as the
fever had its way with him.&nbsp; At first he fought desperately;
but in a little while, realising that he was powerless, he
submitted to her tenderness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;he was awfully good . . . much nicer than when he
was well.&rdquo;&nbsp; She found him patient and pathetic . . .
almost lovable, quite different from the acknowledged success of
the family which he had been at home; and she discovered in
him&mdash;in his tired eyes and even in his voice-an amazing
hidden likeness to their mother which almost moved her to
tears.&nbsp; It seemed as if the fever had suddenly made him a
man instead of the incarnation of a spiritual force.&nbsp; Not
even a man, but a frail, puzzled boy, with no pretensions in the
world.&nbsp; He appealed to her dormant instincts of maternity,
making her all tenderness.&nbsp; She wanted to kiss him as he lay
there with the open unread Bible&mdash;always the Bible&mdash;on
his bed.</p>
<p>When he was at his worst Godovius called to inquire.&nbsp; She
wondered how Godovius knew he was ill, not realising that
Godovius knew everything in <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Luguru.&nbsp; He met her on the stoep
and cross-questioned her narrowly.&nbsp; How much quinine was he
taking?&nbsp; Five grains a day?&nbsp; P&rsquo;ff! . . .&nbsp;
Useless!&nbsp; That was the English method: Manson&rsquo;s
method. . . .&nbsp; Proved useless long ago.&nbsp; The proper way
of taking quinine was the German way, the only reasonable
way&mdash;ten and fifteen grains on two successive days once a
week.&nbsp; That was the only prophylaxis worth
considering.&nbsp; He told her to look at himself, standing there
in his fine, swart robustness, and looking at him she remembered
the poor, transparent child whom she had left within.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what about yourself?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are looking tired, pale.&rdquo;&nbsp; She blushed in a way that
removed the second accusation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not wear
yourself out for him&mdash;you who are young and vigorous and
magnificently healthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; His interest confused her,
and she slipped into the house to see if James would see
Godovius.</p>
<p>He was greatly agitated.&nbsp; He, too, flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Godovius?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why does he
come here when I am in bed?&nbsp; A man who has slaves!&nbsp; No
. . . No . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She protested that he had come with the kindest
intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . not that man,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She made her excuses to Godovius.&nbsp; He looked at her in a
way that revealed their hollowness, then laughed and rode
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not a favourite of your brother?&nbsp;
Now why is that?&nbsp; Mr. Bullace and I were the best of
friends.&nbsp; Do you think we had more in common?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She felt that he had surprised her in <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>a swift remembrance of Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s whisky bottles and was ashamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is better that we should be friendly, don&rsquo;t you think
so?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When he had gone she told James that she thought Godovius had
been offended by the return which had been given him for his
kindness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think he must have heard what you said .
. . these wooden walls are so thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry .
. . very sorry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not quite myself.&nbsp; I was
thinking of those people in the forest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, after a long
interval of thought, he said: &ldquo;I will apologise to
him.&nbsp; It was un-Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She melted: humility on the part of this paragon always
knocked her over.&nbsp; In these moments she very nearly loved
him.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But when James recovered from his bout of fever this
delightful atmosphere of intimacy faded.&nbsp; With diminished
strength but with a greater seriousness than ever he set about
his work.&nbsp; Eva found him increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>I suppose that he had expected to go back to his work as
though nothing had happened, or even, in some miraculous way, to
make up the time which he had lost.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t realise
in the least how much the fever had taken out of him.&nbsp; The
walk to the forest in the morning seemed twice as long: the
upward path, in the evening, purgatorial.&nbsp; Even in the heart
of the <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>forest itself the atmosphere of hopelessness, of evil
swarming like the wood&rsquo;s lush green seemed never to leave
him.&nbsp; Perhaps it was that now he couldn&rsquo;t face
it.&nbsp; All his day was comparable to those moments in which he
had heard the menace of distant drums.&nbsp; Often, indeed, in
the midst of his ministrations he would hear them, so distant
that he couldn&rsquo;t be sure whether they were not some trick
of his fancy, and he would ask the Waluguru women what was the
meaning of the sound.&nbsp; They would shrug their shoulders,
smiling their soft, deprecating smile of Africa with half-closed
eyelids, and say that they did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&rsquo;goma,&rdquo; they would say . . . &ldquo;a
dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&rsquo;goma gani?&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;What sort of
dance?&rdquo; he would ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;A devil
dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they would only smile.&nbsp; There was no getting on
with these people . . .</p>
<p>He determined that if they would not help him he must find out
for himself: and so when next he heard the beat of drums in the
forest he left the colony of huts in which he was working and set
off in pursuit of the sound.&nbsp; Through endless mazy paths of
the swamp he pressed, baffled by many changes of
direction&mdash;for when he had struggled for a mile or two it
seemed to him that all the forest was full of drums, as if the
drummers were leading him a fool&rsquo;s dance and their noise no
more than an elusive emanation of the swamp, a
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp of sound.</p>
<p>It was a terrible quest, for he was already tired, and his
eagerness carried him far beyond his strength.&nbsp; <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Several times
the drumming ceased, leaving him in a silence of utter
desolation, making him think that his struggles had been all for
nothing.&nbsp; At others it seemed so close to him that he pushed
through tangles of undergrowth which no sane man would have
attempted, only to find that he was no nearer his goal.</p>
<p>He must have wandered many miles.&nbsp; In that part of the
forest he found no villages, and all the time he never saw the
sun; but experience had taught him that he must carry a compass,
and by this he judged that under the leaves he was gradually
approaching that part of the swamp which clung about the river at
the point where it issues from a deep cleft in the conical hill
on which Godovius&rsquo;s house was built.&nbsp; Time was
pressing.&nbsp; Farther than this he dared not go, or darkness
would overtake him, and in darkness he could not return.</p>
<p>He was on the point of giving up his search when the drumming
burst out again, a little to the right.&nbsp; He crossed a creek,
knee-deep in black mud, and pushed his way into a clear space
where the smaller trees had been felled and the pointed roofs of
<i>bandas</i> rose among the plantain leaves.&nbsp; As he set
foot within the clearing the drum ceased.&nbsp; He heard a shriek
that sounded scarcely human.&nbsp; Surely he had broken in upon
some unspeakable torture.&nbsp; But when he came into the open
space between the huts he saw nothing more than a little group of
Waluguru women, who cried out in surprise at the invasion of this
pale, bedraggled figure.</p>
<p>There were perhaps a dozen of them, and it seemed <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>to him that
they had been engaged in the crushing of sugar-cane for the
making of <i>tembo</i>, their fermented drink, for they were
grouped about two of the hollowed trunks in which the fibre is
shredded with poles in the manner of a pestle and mortar.&nbsp;
That was all that he could see, except for one old man, with an
evil face, squatting in the doorway of the largest <i>banda</i>,
staring straight before him, and one woman, a girl of sixteen or
seventeen years, who lay almost naked on the ground with her arms
clasped above her head, as though she were asleep or very
ill.</p>
<p>James addressed them, and the old man gravely returned his
salutation with a flat hand lifted to his brow.&nbsp; He blurted
out rapid questions.&nbsp; He had heard a drum.&nbsp; Where was
the <i>N&rsquo;goma</i>?</p>
<p>They shook their heads and smiled.&nbsp; They knew of no
N&rsquo;goma.</p>
<p>He spoke to them of other things: of food and fever . . . life
and death . . . the matters which most concerned them.&nbsp; They
answered him politely, but with a tired tolerance.&nbsp; Food was
scarce, and the devil of fever was among them; but it was always
so.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch.&nbsp; It was getting late.&nbsp; He
knew that he had failed again and that he must go.&nbsp; When
James pulled out his watch he saw the eyes of the old man light
up and heard a murmur among the women in which he caught the word
<i>Sakharani</i>.&nbsp; Of course . . . Godovius, too, had a
watch.&nbsp; No people, it seemed, were too remote to know
Godovius.&nbsp; He wondered if Bullace had ever visited this
village.&nbsp; <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>He turned to go, and at the same moment the galloping
triplets of another drum began in some neighbouring
village.&nbsp; He saw the women smile, and this irritated him so
much that he burst out into abuse of the old man, who still sat
unsmiling in the door of his <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; And then a
strange thing happened.&nbsp; The body of the girl who had lain
motionless upon the ground in their midst was shaken by a sound
that was like a sob, but somehow less human.&nbsp; Her hands,
which had been sheltering her head, clutched at her
breasts.&nbsp; Then, as the faint drumming continued, her head
began to move in time, her limbs and her body were gradually
drawn into the measure of the distant rhythm till, with a
steadily increasing violence, each muscle of her slender frame
seemed to be obeying this tyrannical influence, so that she was
no longer mistress of herself, no longer anything but a mass of
quivering, palpitating muscle.&nbsp; A horrible sight . . . very
horrible.&nbsp; And then, when her miserable body was so torn
that the tortured muscles could bear it no longer, there was
wrung from her that ghastly, sub-human cry which James had heard
in the forest as he approached.&nbsp; It was like the noise which
a cat makes when it is in pain.</p>
<p>The others took no heed of her; they went on pounding
<i>tembo</i>; but James, to whose disordered nerves the horror of
the sight had become intolerable, could do no more.&nbsp; He
burst out again into the forest, pushing his way blindly through
vast tangles which he might have avoided, spending the remains of
his strength in a futile endeavour to escape <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>anywhere,
anyhow, from that nightmare.&nbsp; The forest grew darker.&nbsp;
Even in the open bush, when he emerged, the short twilight had
come.&nbsp; For him it was enough to know that he was out of the
forest.&nbsp; He lay down at the side of the path panting and
trembling.&nbsp; Here, in the cool of the night, his reason
gradually reasserted itself.&nbsp; He was humiliated and ashamed
to realise that his faith had failed him, that terror had broken
the strength of his spirit.&nbsp; And thus, being full of
repentance, he seriously considered whether he should not turn
back, pushing his way through the forest to that remote village,
and see the business through.&nbsp; This time he would be certain
not to fail.&nbsp; In the end he abandoned this test, which he
would gladly have undergone; for he doubted if he could find the
path again, and guessed that his purpose would probably be ruined
by another attack of fever.&nbsp; But he determined that once
again, in daylight, he would find that village and that woman,
that he would strip bare the mysteries which it contained, and
that by faith and prayer he would conquer them.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Of course he did not confide in Eva.&nbsp; To him she was
never any more than the small girl who had watched his triumphs
from the seclusion of the little shop at Far Forest, to whom the
privilege of dealing with his clothes, mired in the
M&rsquo;ssente swamps, was now entrusted.&nbsp; Indeed it was a
pity that he left Eva out of his preoccupations; for nothing is
more <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>dangerous to the born mystic than isolation from his
fellow men, and the conditions of the isolation which James
endured in the forest were extreme.&nbsp; It is doubtful, too,
whether the constant companionship of such fiery fellows as the
prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, to whom James resorted in the hours
when he sat in loneliness with his open Bible, was good for him
in his present state of unstable emotion.&nbsp; The directness,
the simplicity, the common-sense of Eva would have helped him;
but she knew better than to interrupt her brother when he was
engaged with the prophets.&nbsp; In Far Forest they called it
<i>The Book</i>.</p>
<p>So James went on his way, fighting for ever against the
weakness to which his fever had reduced him in this visionary
company.&nbsp; For sheer weakness he was forced to spend more
time in the neighbourhood of the mission, busying himself with
the education of Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s converts, whom he had rather
neglected in his anxieties to break new ground.&nbsp; To break
new ground. . . .&nbsp; His mind was always ready to play with
words, and thinking of this familiar metaphor, he remembered one
day how an old African planter had spoken with him on board ship;
how he had told him that he should never dig a trench for storm
water round his tent, because the act of breaking virgin soil
released the miasma of fever inherent in the jealous earth.&nbsp;
That, he thought, was figuratively what had happened to
him.&nbsp; And finding that he had worked the metaphor to its
logical conclusion, he was ashamed to think that his mind could
have been diverted into such foolish byways.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>He was
so eager to assure himself that he had recovered his balance that
he deliberately discounted things which at one time would have
disturbed or frightened him.&nbsp; But one thing he could not
persuade himself to dismiss from his thoughts, try as he
might&mdash;there was scarcely a day in his life when he did not
find it staring him in the face or lurking invisibly behind the
disappointments that troubled him&mdash;and this was the
influence of Godovius among the Waluguru.&nbsp; Whenever he found
himself thwarted by some failure, often enough a small thing in
itself, he was conscious of the man&rsquo;s imminence.&nbsp; The
name of <i>Sakharani</i> was often the only word which he could
recognise in whisperings that were not meant for his ear.&nbsp;
When the <i>shambas</i> of Godovius needed tilling the mission
classes must go.&nbsp; In every occurrence that balked him, in
every mystery that baffled, the influence of <i>Sakharani</i> was
betrayed.&nbsp; And as time went by he realised that the menace
was a very real one.&nbsp; He felt that he was actually losing
grip, so that a sense of insecurity invaded even the matters in
which he had felt most confident.&nbsp; The fact had to be faced:
the original congregation of the mission, the very existence of
which had gladdened and strengthened his heart on Sundays, was
undoubtedly dwindling; and what vexed him even more was to find
that some of his favourite converts, men on whom he had felt he
could rely and whose tongues were accustomed to the Christian
formula, seemed to fail him as readily as the others.&nbsp; He
was honestly and miserably puzzled.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Almost
against his will he began to suspect the hand of Godovius in
every trace of opposition which he encountered.&nbsp; Whenever he
failed he grew to dread the mention of Godovius&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; And this was all the more troubling because Godovius
came fairly frequently to the mission.&nbsp; When James returned
in the evening he would find flowers from Njumba ja Mweze in his
study, or hear from Eva that he had been helping her in the
garden or lent her some new book.&nbsp; It distressed him.&nbsp;
He never spoke of him to Eva; but for all that he would wait
anxiously for her to mention his name, and that feeling of
insecurity and grudging would come over him whenever the name
appeared.</p>
<p>It was after many weeks that his growing distrust reached its
climax.&nbsp; At the end of that time he set out early one day to
visit the village to which he had penetrated in search of the
heathen drums.&nbsp; That day the way seemed miraculously
easy.&nbsp; He could scarcely believe that he was passing through
those miles of tangled forest in which he had once struggled to
exhaustion; but when he arrived there the little circle of huts
was the same as ever; the same women were crushing sugar-cane for
<i>tembo</i>; the same evil-faced man squatted in the mouth of
the greatest <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; He talked to them, and they
answered him happily enough until he came to question them about
the girl who had then been lying on the ground and had only been
recalled to consciousness by the thud of the distant drum.&nbsp;
When he asked for her they dissembled, with their soft African
smiles.&nbsp; He became suspicious and <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>pressed them.&nbsp; Where was
she?&nbsp; He would not go until they told him where she
was.&nbsp; The women began to speak; but the old man in the mouth
of the <i>banda</i> made them be silent.</p>
<p>James started to question him, asked him why he would not let
them answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Sakharani&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; That is
enough,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has gone
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where she had gone he would not say, protesting that he did
not know.&nbsp; He only knew that she had gone from them at the
last new moon.&nbsp; Perhaps she would return.&nbsp; That was the
business of Sakharani.&nbsp; More than this he could not say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find out,&rdquo; said James.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know you are deceiving me . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man only shook his head and smiled.</p>
<p>Walking home that evening on the bush path James heard a
scurry of hoofs and saw the big outline of Godovius cantering
down on his Somali mule, with a Waluguru boy running at his
stirrup.&nbsp; Godovius, too, spotted him, and waved him a cheery
good-evening.&nbsp; James guessed that he had been up at the
mission.&nbsp; He determined to speak to Eva.</p>
<p>When he reached home he found her busy laying the table for
him.&nbsp; She seemed happy and well: she was humming to herself
an old song that reminded him of Far Forest.&nbsp; He would speak
to her now . . .</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Has Mr. Godovius been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes . . . he has only just gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered why he was asking this with such <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>intensity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish him to come here.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think he is a good man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he
is fit company for you.&nbsp; To-day&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He
stopped, for it struck him that he might appear foolish if he
went on.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;You like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . I don&rsquo;t think I do, exactly.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mind him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s . . . he&rsquo;s funny,
you know. . . .&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I understand
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been making love to you?&rdquo; James asked in a
whisper.</p>
<p>Eva blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he hasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; What an
idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought: &ldquo;How very funny. . . .&nbsp; James is
jealous.&nbsp; Father was like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had felt sure that she would prevaricate.&nbsp; Her
directness took the wind out of his sails.&nbsp; He felt rather
ashamed of his suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I asked you that question,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t forget
that I warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed to herself.&nbsp; The idea of Godovius as a lover
struck her as grotesque.&nbsp; Later she wondered why it had
struck her as grotesque.</p>

70</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> those days James was never free
from fever for long, despite the German method of quinine
prophylaxis to which, in defiance of Manson, he had
submitted.&nbsp; It seemed as if the tertian parasite&mdash;and
there is none more malignant than that which the M&rsquo;ssente
Swamp breeds&mdash;had rejoiced to find a virgin blood in which
it might flourish as long as life lasted.&nbsp; Every ten days or
so Eva would find herself called upon to face a new attack.&nbsp;
She became used to the succession of shivering and high fever;
she began to know exactly when James should be bullied and when
he should be left alone; to realise how the sweet submissiveness
of the sick man merged into the irritability of the
convalescent.&nbsp; Symptoms that once would have frightened her
out of her life were now part of the day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; She
steadfastly determined that she would let nothing worry
her.&nbsp; It was just as well to have one equable person in the
house.</p>
<p>Godovius still came to the mission from time to time.&nbsp;
Eva was glad to see him.&nbsp; She would have been glad to see
almost any man; for the idea of being quite alone in those savage
solitudes was frightening.&nbsp; She was not ignorant of the
power of disease in that country.&nbsp; She knew perfectly well
that some day <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;something might happen&rdquo; (as they say) to
James, and without definitely anticipating it she felt a little
happier for having the strength of Godovius behind her.&nbsp; For
he was strong, whatever else he might be.&nbsp; In his presence
she was always conscious of that: and even if his strength seemed
at times a little sinister, there were moments in which he struck
her as wholly charming, almost boyish, particularly when he
smiled and his beautiful teeth showed white against the ruddy
swarthiness of his face.&nbsp; Seriously, too, he was ready to
help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother is overworking,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think the unfortunate results to himself are
balanced by any colossal success in his work?&nbsp; Do you?&nbsp;
I think he should take a little alcohol . . . a sundowner . . .
quite a good thing for Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eva smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have a fit if I told him
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he? . . .&nbsp; In many ways your brother does
not resemble the Good Bullace.&nbsp; And yet in others I think he
deserves a little of my name . . . Sakharani.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe, Miss Eva, you are still rather
frightened of my name.&nbsp; Now how long is it since last you
saw me drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though she protested, she wasn&rsquo;t altogether sure
that he was joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never know when I may break out,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you witness nothing but my admirable
self-control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every time that Godovius came to see her when James was in bed
her brother would question her narrowly as to what he had
said.&nbsp; His persistence <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>annoyed her, because it seemed to her
ungenerous that he should not take Godovius as he found him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell you when next he
comes,&rdquo; she said one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be no good. . . .&nbsp; I know. . . .&nbsp;
I have a feeling in my bones when he is here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
like some people who shiver when a cat comes into the room even
if they don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s rather horrid of you,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it that you&rsquo;re jealous? . . .&nbsp;
Or don&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I trust <i>you</i> all right,&rdquo; he said
bitterly.</p>
<p>In the intervals between his attacks he brightened up
wonderfully.&nbsp; It was difficult to believe that he was the
same man; but for all this he had lost a great deal of weight,
and his face showed a blue and yellow pallor which alarmed
her.&nbsp; And he was sleeping very badly.&nbsp; Eva became
accustomed to the sound of his footsteps walking up and down his
room at night, and to the whining voice in which he would recite
long passages of scripture.&nbsp; She knew that some day there
must come a big breakdown.&nbsp; Yes . . . it was good to have
Godovius behind her.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Insidiously the occasion which she had looked for came.&nbsp;
An ordinary attack of malaria, one of her brother&rsquo;s usual
ten-daily diversions, flamed suddenly into a condition which she
could not understand.&nbsp; The babble of a night of delirium
died away, and in the morning, with cheeks still flushed and all
the signs <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>of fever with which she was familiar, Eva found him
becoming drowsy and yet more drowsy.&nbsp; Usually in this stage
of the disease she knew him to be exacting and restlessly
active.&nbsp; This time when she came to give him food she had
difficulty in rousing him.&nbsp; He lay huddled on his side with
his legs drawn up and his face turned away from the light.&nbsp;
Even when she had wakened him he fell asleep again.&nbsp; The
warm milk which she had brought him went cold under a yellowish
scum at his bedside.&nbsp; All that afternoon she did not once
hear him praying.</p>
<p>She became anxious.&nbsp; Perhaps Godovius would come.&nbsp;
She wished that he would; for she knew that he could help her:
all the Waluguru bore witness how great a medicine-man he
was.&nbsp; But Godovius did not come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just because I
want him,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>For a few moments in the afternoon James brightened up.&nbsp;
He complained to her of the pain in his head, which he had
clasped in his hands all day; but even as he spoke to her his
mind wandered, wandered back into the Book of Kings and the story
of the Shunammite&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he said unto his
father, My head, my head.&nbsp; And he said to a lad: Carry him
to his mother,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; Then he was quiet for a
little.&nbsp; Eva sat by his side, watching.&nbsp; Now at last he
seemed to be sleeping gently.&nbsp; She expected that this was
what he needed, but in the early evening, when next she wanted to
feed him, he would not wake.&nbsp; She spoke to him, and gently
shook him.&nbsp; A terror seized her lest he should have
died.&nbsp; <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>No . . . he was still breathing.&nbsp; For so much she
might be thankful.</p>
<p>Something must be done.&nbsp; In this extremity her mind
naturally turned to Godovius.&nbsp; At James&rsquo;s desk she
scribbled a note to him, and ran out into the compound at the
back of the house to the hut of galvanised iron in which the boys
slept.&nbsp; She called them both by name, but no answer
came.&nbsp; The mouth of their den was covered with an old piece
of sacking, which she pulled aside, releasing an air that stank
of wood-smoke, and oil and black flesh.&nbsp; Almost sickened,
she peered inside.&nbsp; Only one of the boys was sleeping
there.&nbsp; He lay curled up in the corner, so that she could
not see which of them it was, his head and shoulders covered with
a dirty red blanket.&nbsp; She had to shake him before she could
rouse him.&nbsp; He stared at her out of the darkness with dazed
eyes.&nbsp; Then he smiled, and she saw by his filed cannibal
teeth that it was Onyango, the M&rsquo;kamba . . . just the one
whom she didn&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; Hamisi, the Luguru, would have
known the way to Godovius&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Hamisi?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Onyango still rubbed his eyes.&nbsp; He did not know.&nbsp;
She told him that Hamisi must be found.&nbsp; He shook his head
and smiled.&nbsp; Hamisi, he said, could not be found.&nbsp; It
was useless to try and find him.</p>
<p>Eva was irritated by his foolish, smiling face.&nbsp; Why had
Hamisi gone away, just when he was wanted most? she asked.</p>
<p>Onyango mumbled something which surpassed her knowledge of
Swahili . . . something about the new <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>moon.&nbsp; What in the world had the
new moon to do with it? . . .</p>
<p>Very well, then, she decided&mdash;Onyango must take
Godovius&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the house of Sakharani?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carry this <i>barua</i> to Sakharani himself . . . quickly
. . . very quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave him the letter.&nbsp;
Onyango shrank back into his corner.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t take
the letter, he said.&nbsp; If he took the letter on this night
the Waluguru would kill him.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t seem to
understand, and he made the motion of a violent spear-thrust,
then clutched at his breast.&nbsp; Eva tried to laugh him out of
it, to make him ashamed at being afraid; but it was no
good.&nbsp; Why should the Waluguru kill him? she asked.</p>
<p>It was the night of the new moon, he said.</p>
<p>She saw that it was useless to waste time over him.&nbsp;
While they had been disputing the sun had set.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful and very peaceful evening.&nbsp; The crowns of the
croton-trees were awakening that soft zodiacal glow.&nbsp; She
was very angry and worried, for she realised that she would have
to go herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, you must stay with the
<i>bwana</i>,&rdquo; she said: and Onyango, who still wanted to
be ingratiating and was ready to do anything but face the new
moon and the Waluguru, slunk into the house.&nbsp; She took a
last look at James.&nbsp; There was no difference in his
condition except that now he was obviously alive, breathing
stertorously through his mouth, lying there with his eyes half
opened.&nbsp; She wondered for a moment if she dared leave
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell the <i>bwana</i> <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>when he
wakes,&rdquo; she said to Onyango, &ldquo;where I have
gone.&nbsp; Say that I will come back again.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
feared to stay there any longer, for in a little while it would
be dark.&nbsp; She comforted herself with the thought that the
road through the forest to Njumba ja Mweze must be fairly well
defined, since Godovius used it so often.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t disguise from herself the fact that the adventure
was rather frightening, but the thing had to be done, and there
was an end of it.</p>
<p>So she took the forest road.&nbsp; In the open Park Steppe
there were already signs of night: most of all a silence in which
no voices of birds were heard, and other dry rustlings, which
would have been submerged beneath the noises of day, heralded the
awakening of another kind of life.&nbsp; In the branches of
thorn-trees on every side the cicalas set up vibrations: as rapid
and intense as those of an electric spark: a very natural sound,
for it seemed to be an expression of that highly charged
silence.&nbsp; In a wide slade of grasses a herd of kongoni were
grazing.&nbsp; When they caught the scent of Eva they reached
their heads above the grasses and after following her for a
little with their eyes one of them took fright, and with one
accord they flashed into the bordering bush, a flying streak of
brown.&nbsp; An aged wildebeeste bull, vanquished in some old
duel and banished from his own herd, stood sentinel to the
kongoni, and when the others disappeared he held his ground,
standing with his enormous shoulders firmly planted on his fore
feet.&nbsp; Eva was rather frightened of him, for she knew
nothing of the nature or habits of big game.&nbsp; As <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>she passed
across the opening of that glade he slowly turned, so that his
great shoulders and lowered head were always facing her.&nbsp;
Some unimaginable breeze must have been moving from her towards
him, for he suddenly threw up his head, snorting, and stamped the
ground.&nbsp; Then she picked up her skirts and ran, with his
mighty breathing still in her ears.&nbsp; She saw that this night
journey of hers was going to be no joke.&nbsp; In the night so
many savage beasts were abroad.&nbsp; She remembered that less
than a week before Godovius had shot a leopard on the edge of the
forest.&nbsp; He had told her how the creature had been lying
along the low branch of a tree, and how it had sprung into the
midst of a herd of goats which a Waluguru boy was driving along
the track.&nbsp; Godovius had been near and his second shot had
killed it.&nbsp; He had offered her the skin.&nbsp; Now, for the
very first time, she realised the savagery of that land.&nbsp; In
the mission there had always dwelt a sense of homeliness and
protection.&nbsp; She realised, too, the conditions in which
James had been working.&nbsp; Poor James. . . .&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that she herself was better qualified
to deal with that sort of thing than her brother.&nbsp; She
pulled all her courage together.</p>
<p>She had come to the edge of the forest.&nbsp; Black and
immense it lay before her.&nbsp; If she made haste she might
still borrow a little courage from the light.&nbsp; The sky above
the tree-tops was now deepening to a dusky blue.&nbsp; As yet no
stars appeared; but over the crown of that sudden hill a slender
crescent of the new moon was soaring.&nbsp; A lovely slip of a
thing she <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>seemed sailing in that liquid sky.&nbsp; A memory of
Eva&rsquo;s childhood reminded her that if she had been carrying
money in her pocket she should have turned it for luck and
wished. . . .&nbsp; What would she have wished?</p>
<p>It gave her a new assurance to find that under the leaves the
path was well defined.&nbsp; She reckoned that she had at the
most no more than three miles to go.&nbsp; At the end of three
miles she would see the lights of Godovius&rsquo;s house and not
be frightened any longer.&nbsp; She made up her mind to travel as
fast as she could, looking neither to left nor right, for fear of
eyes which might be watching her from the thickets.&nbsp; She
comforted herself with the thought that it was here that the
Waluguru lived; that they had lived here for centuries and were
as unprotected as herself; that there were actually women and
children living there in the heart of the forest.&nbsp; In the
silence she heard the soft cooing of a dove, and a minute later a
couple of small grey birds fluttered up from the path.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As harmless as doves,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
beautiful little creatures . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; And she smiled.</p>
<p>As she penetrated farther into the forest the light failed
her, and it was very still.&nbsp; The little fluttering doves
were the last creatures that she saw for a long time.&nbsp; Of
the people of the forest there was no sign, and she would have
thought that there were no beasts abroad either but for an
occasional distant sound of crashing branches made by some body
bigger and more powerful than that of a man.&nbsp; By the time
that the light of day had wholly faded from the sky she had come
to a zone of the forest in which the trees were <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>more thinly
scattered: between their high branches stars appeared, in front
of her a blurred outline, which she took to be that of Kilima ja
Mweze, above which the crescent moon now whitely shone.&nbsp; A
little later she found that the track was ascending.&nbsp; It had
reached the slopes of the conical hill on which she knew that
Godovius&rsquo;s house was placed.&nbsp; Here under a brighter
starlight she could see that the whole hill-side was cut into
terraces, like the stages of a wedding cake, along the face of
which the track climbed obliquely.&nbsp; It reassured her to find
that she was now within a definite sphere of human influence,
that the most savage part of her pilgrimage was past: but the
road made stiff climbing: the mantle of forest had concealed the
lower slopes of the hill so completely that she had never
realised how abruptly it rose from the swamp.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the half light, she saw upon the terrace above
her a building of stone.&nbsp; She stopped for a moment to regain
her breath, for this must surely be one of the outbuildings of
the House of the Moon.&nbsp; When she came abreast of it she was
puzzled to find that it was nothing but a circular wall of rough
stones piled one upon the other.&nbsp; All around it the forest
trees had been cut down; and this seemed to her a great waste of
labour, for the building could obviously be no more than a stone
kraal for the protection of cattle.&nbsp; Now it was empty.&nbsp;
The track which she was following passed close to the only breach
in the circle of stone.&nbsp; She peered inside, and saw that the
wall was double.&nbsp; In the centre of the circular space within
rose a <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>strange tower, shaped like a conical lime-kiln of the
kind which she had known at home but more slender, and fashioned
of the same rough stone as the double walls outside.&nbsp; As she
looked within her presence disturbed another flight of doves,
fluttering pale in the moonlight.&nbsp; She wondered whatever
could be the meaning of this building, for the doves would not
nest there if it were used by men and cattle; but her curiosity
was overborne by her disappointment at finding that her journey
was not yet over.&nbsp; From that clearing she passed once more
into denser forest, under the shadow of which she climbed perhaps
a dozen more of those steep terraces.&nbsp; Once more the forest
trees gave way to an open space.&nbsp; A wave of sweet but
over-heavy perfume came to meet her.&nbsp; Pale in the moonlight
she saw the ghost of a long white house.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>A length of white-washed stoep supported on slender pillars
faced her, and from the stoep a flight of wide steps descended to
the sandy path over which she had climbed out of the
forest.&nbsp; There was no fence or <i>boma</i> to mark the
transition from the desert to the sown; so that the House of the
Moon was really set like any Waluguru village in a sudden
clearing of the forest; and this seemed strange to Eva, for she
had imagined that the house of Godovius would be more in keeping
with his wealth and power.&nbsp; She had expected to find a
garden carefully tended, an oasis of urbanity and
fragrance.&nbsp; Fragrance indeed there was.&nbsp; <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>The wave of
perfume which had met her emerging from the forest path eddied
gently in the garden space about the open cups of many moon-pale
blossoms, blooms of the white moon-flower from which the scent
named frangipani is distilled: and although she was happily
unaware of this perfume&rsquo;s associations, Eva felt that she
hated it, that its cloying sweetness robbed the air of
life.&nbsp; Very pale and ghostly the flowers hung there in the
faint moonlight, in so great a congregation that one was aware of
their life, and thought of them as verily living creatures,
silent only because they were entranced with their own
sweetness.&nbsp; In the gloom of the long verandah no light
shone.&nbsp; The windows within were unlighted.&nbsp; The long
house seemed as empty as the building of circular stone which she
had passed below.</p>
<p>Eva mounted the steps.&nbsp; Over the floor of white stone a
big lizard moved noiselessly.&nbsp; There was a fluttering sound
in the masses of bougainvillea above the porch, a clapping of
wings, and a little flight of doves fluttered out above the
moon-flower blossoms and vanished into the forest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This place is full of doves,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; It
was so quiet that she began to wonder if they were the only
tenants.</p>
<p>She remembered that in Africa people do not wait for an
invitation to enter the houses of their friends, nor for servants
to announce their coming.&nbsp; No doubt Godovius would have
expected her to open the door and walk into the house, and yet
she hardly liked to do this, for the whole place seemed to be
sleeping under some spell which it might be rash to break.&nbsp;
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>For a
moment she stood waiting on the threshold.&nbsp; It was a double
door massively made, with panels of fine mosquito netting instead
of glass.&nbsp; Inside it she imagined there must be a wide
flagged passage, smelling of damp.&nbsp; She saw that the pillars
supporting the lintel were of a different kind of stone from that
of which the rest of the house was built: they were smooth, and
their capitals were carved into the shape of the head of some
bird of prey with hooked beak and staring eyes.&nbsp; While she
hesitated she remembered the pitiful room of James, down at the
mission, and the last that she had seen of James himself, lying
on his back, with his mouth open, breathing stertorously, and
clutching at his head with unconscious hands . . . thin,
incapable hands.</p>
<p>She tried to open the door, and found it locked.&nbsp; So this
was the end of her adventure. . . .&nbsp; An end so pathetic to
the courage which she had screwed up that she wouldn&rsquo;t
accept it.&nbsp; She beat upon the door with the palms of her
hands.</p>
<p>A light appeared.&nbsp; Through the mosquito gauze she saw a
small figure approaching, swathed in a white cloth and carrying a
blizzard lamp.&nbsp; She thought it was that of a child, but a
hand fumbled with the key in the lock and she saw that the
lantern-bearer was an old and shrivelled woman who stared at her
but did not speak.</p>
<p>Eva stammered over her Swahili.&nbsp; Was this the house of
Godovius? . . .&nbsp; Was the <i>bwana</i> in?</p>
<p>The old woman only stared.&nbsp; Then, she remembered the name
that she had been <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>wanting&mdash;Sakharani.&nbsp; She repeated her question
in that form.&nbsp; The old woman nodded.&nbsp; She opened wide
her mouth and pointed with her finger.&nbsp; Eva saw a collection
of hideous teeth and a purple stump that once had been a
tongue.&nbsp; It was very horrible.&nbsp; And then the creature
led her along the passage and pushed open the door of a long, low
room.&nbsp; On the open hearth a wood fire flickered, from which
she carried a light to a copper lamp that swung from the
ceiling.&nbsp; When this was done she shuffled out of the
room.&nbsp; The hanging lamp with its reflectors of copper shed a
mellow light, and when Eva&rsquo;s first bewilderment was past
she began to appreciate the embellishments of Godovius&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; It resembled no room which she had ever seen before:
nor, for that matter, was it in the least like what she had
imagined the room of Godovius would be.&nbsp; To begin with, the
floor was covered with a soft carpet in the pattern of which the
lamplight illumined warm colours.&nbsp; On either side of the
fireplace an immense divan upholstered in crimson lay.&nbsp; One
of them was half covered with a barbarous kaross of leopard
skins, the other piled deep with cushions of silk.&nbsp; The door
by which she had entered was covered by a porti&egrave;re of
heavy velvet of the same crimson colour with a wide hem of
tarnished gold.&nbsp; Everywhere there were cushions, big, soft
cushions.&nbsp; And there were no books.&nbsp; The air of the
room seemed in keeping with its furniture, for even here the
cloying scent of the moon-flowers had penetrated.&nbsp; Eva had
an impulse to open the window, or at any rate to draw the crimson
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>curtains;
but the atmosphere of the place suggested that liberties must not
be taken with it.&nbsp; She wondered why on earth they had lit a
fire . . .</p>
<p>By this time, her eyes being more accustomed to the mild
light, she began to regard the room in greater detail.&nbsp; She
saw that the mantelpiece above the fireplace had been made out of
the same smooth soapstone which she had noticed in the lintel of
the outer door, and that the ends of the beams were carved with
the same conventional figure of a bird&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; On the
mantelpiece itself stood other pieces of soapstone carving: two
small, quern-shaped cylinders chased with rings of rosettes;
three smaller and more elementary versions of the original bird
pattern.&nbsp; She supposed that they were curios of the country,
but was rather puzzled to find the one symbol so often
repeated.&nbsp; She decided that she would ask James about
them.&nbsp; From these she passed to an examination of the
pictures, in heavy frames of gold, which decorated the
walls.&nbsp; They were not easily seen; for the copper reflector
of the hanging lamp cast its rays downwards, leaving a colder
light for the upper part of the room.&nbsp; The first that she
came to was a painting in oils of the bust and shoulders of a
Masai girl, her head thrown back, her lips smiling and eyes
closed.&nbsp; From her ears hung crescent-shaped ornaments of
gold, and a big golden crescent was bound across her forehead: a
clever painting, with the suggestion of a shimmer of moonlight on
her smooth shoulders.&nbsp; Eva wondered why her eyes were
closed, <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>and why she smiled.&nbsp; Would Godovius never come? . .
.</p>
<p>On the opposite wall hung a large framed photograph.&nbsp; Eva
stood on tiptoe to examine it.&nbsp; When she saw what it was,
she was overwhelmed with a sudden and awful feeling of
shame.&nbsp; She had never felt so ashamed in her life.&nbsp; She
found herself betrayed into a funny childish gesture: she put her
hands to her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I can never look at him
again,&rdquo; she thought. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear, how
terrible . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Godovius of the picture was obviously not
ashamed.&nbsp; He was younger than the Godovius that she knew:
the face smooth and unlined, the full lips smiling.&nbsp; In this
presentation, despite the German colonial uniform of white duck
which he wore, one could not help seeing that he was of Jewish
extraction.&nbsp; One hand clasped the hilt of his sword, the
other arm was linked through that of a woman, a white woman with
a stolid, eminently Teuton face.&nbsp; And the woman was naked .
. . stark naked.&nbsp; To any English eyes the photograph would
have come as a shock.&nbsp; And Eva was a simple country girl,
who knew no more of life than the little shop at Far Forest had
shown her.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t get over it.&nbsp; She sat
down among the downy cushions on the scarlet settee and
blushed.&nbsp; She thought: &ldquo;I must go.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
stay in this dreadful house.&nbsp; I should die if I met him
now.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t. . . .&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she thought once more of James.</p>
<p>Only it was all so difficult, so horrible, that she could have
cried.&nbsp; Even as she sat with her back to <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>it she was
conscious of that photograph, of the lips of Godovius and that
poor cow-like creature.&nbsp; The thing was subtly in keeping
with the rest of the room, the soft carpet and the cushions, the
lavish crimson and gold, the sickly scent of frangipani.&nbsp;
She shuddered.&nbsp; In another moment she would have gone
precipitately.&nbsp; She had even risen to her feet when the
velvet porti&egrave;re swung back and Godovius himself entered
the room.</p>
<p>He smiled and held out his hand: &ldquo;At last, Miss
Eva.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile resembled that of the man in the photograph; his
cheeks were flushed; he looked far younger than usual.&nbsp; She
forced herself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James is ill . . . that is why I came.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t understand him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m terribly
distressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate you have come at last. . . .&nbsp; What is
your brother&rsquo;s trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Eva it was a tremendous relief to talk of it.&nbsp; She
told him how she had left James; implored him to let her know if
the condition were serious.&nbsp; He listened, a thought
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quinine?&nbsp; He has had plenty of
quinine?&nbsp; Then you can do nothing more.&nbsp; This cerebral
type of malaria is not uncommon.&nbsp; To-morrow it is possible
he will be better.&nbsp; To-morrow . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t do anything?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you help me at
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . there is no other treatment,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have troubled you.&nbsp; I was so <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>distressed.&nbsp; I must get back quickly.&nbsp; Perhaps
you will spare me one of your boys to show me the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was plucky of you to come alone . . . at this time
of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was moonlight . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes . . . the new moon.&nbsp; You are a brave girl,
Miss Eva.&nbsp; Why then are you frightened now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frightened,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What made you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And of course she was horribly frightened.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t quite say why.&nbsp; On other occasions the dread
or distaste, or whatever the feeling might be, which the thought
of him inspired had always vanished in his bodily presence.&nbsp;
This time she felt it more acutely than ever, and since it was
now reinforced by his physical imminence, it seemed harder to
bear.&nbsp; It came to her suddenly that if he were once assured
that she was really frightened of him it would be all up with
her.&nbsp; That was why she lied so eagerly.</p>
<p>He stood leisurely surveying her, with the same smile on his
flushed face.&nbsp; He took no notice of her denial.&nbsp; He was
big and dark and smiling; and all the time she was appallingly
conscious of the contrast of her own physical weakness, wondering
how, if anything dreadful should happen, she might escape.&nbsp;
It was as bad as that.&nbsp; He gave her an exaggerated bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, then.&nbsp; We will agree that you are not
frightened.&nbsp; In that case there is really no reason why you
shouldn&rsquo;t sit down and give me the pleasure, for a little,
of your society.&nbsp; I beg you to be seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought: &ldquo;If I sit down I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have a
ghost <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of a
chance; I shall feel he&rsquo;s right on the top of me.&nbsp; If
I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> sit down he&rsquo;ll know just how
frightened I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a compromise she placed herself
on the arm of the long sofa.&nbsp; At this elevation she
didn&rsquo;t feel quite so helpless.&nbsp; She made a determined
effort to escape.</p>
<p>She began: &ldquo;My brother . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes . . . your brother . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He began
to prowl up and down the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your brother. . .
.&nbsp; You need not worry yourself too much about him, Miss
Eva.&nbsp; It is unkind of you to be so sparing of your
devotion.&nbsp; Your brother is lonely?&nbsp; Well, there are
other people as lonely as your brother.&nbsp; Do you remember my
saying that my eyes hadn&rsquo;t rested on a white woman for more
than five years?&nbsp; There are varieties of loneliness.&nbsp;
Spiritual loneliness . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while she was thinking of the photograph on the wall
behind him.</p>
<p>He checked himself.&nbsp; The little flicker of passion which
had found its way into his speech and made a mess of the last of
his quite admirable English fell.&nbsp; Again he became
polite.&nbsp; She would almost have preferred the other
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it appears you are not interested, Miss Eva.&nbsp;
At least you will allow me to treat you as an ordinary guest . .
. an honoured guest.&nbsp; You will taste my coffee: perhaps you
will even permit me the pleasure of showing you my poor
house.&nbsp; Visitors are so rare . . . so very rare.&nbsp; And
there was some music that I had promised myself to play for you .
. . the tenderest music that the noble mind of a man ever made:
Eva&rsquo;s music . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>And all
the time she felt that he was spinning words; that his quiet,
caressing manners didn&rsquo;t in the least represent what was
passing in the man&rsquo;s mind; that he was talking to gain
time, and, while he talked, forming some plan or other which
threatened her peace.&nbsp; She had an awful feeling that there
was something mad and sinister forming within his mind.&nbsp; In
what other wise could she explain the cool unreason with which he
had almost ignored her appeal for help?&nbsp; It seemed as if he
had put the question of James&rsquo; illness aside from the first
as something that didn&rsquo;t really matter; as if he
wouldn&rsquo;t accept it as the reason for her coming.&nbsp; The
illogical nature of the thing frightened her.&nbsp; And she, too,
was not listening to what he said.&nbsp; She was thinking:
&ldquo;That woman in the picture . . . how did she come to be so
degraded?&nbsp; What, in the end, became of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on talking in the same smoothly persuasive
tones.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t listen to him.&nbsp; She heard him
laugh softly in the middle of what he was saying.&nbsp; She
wondered if perhaps he were drunk.&nbsp; He came and stood close
above her, putting his hand on her upper arm just below the
shoulder.&nbsp; Through her cotton blouse she could feel the heat
of it.&nbsp; It would have been less disturbing if it had been
deadly cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired, you must rest a little,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not have you tired.&nbsp; You will be
quiet a little.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you sit down?&nbsp; The
room is not uncomfortable.&nbsp; You will wait while I bring you
some hot coffee.&nbsp; You should know how good my coffee is . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>He was
still holding her arm.&nbsp; The fingers of his hand moved
gently.&nbsp; She felt that he was permitting himself to caress
it.&nbsp; She obeyed him.&nbsp; She let herself sink into the
crimson cushions of the sofa.&nbsp; He seemed pleased with her
acquiescence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not leave you for long,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then perhaps I will see you
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone.</p>
<p>She could not believe that he had left her.&nbsp; Somehow she
had felt that she was cornered, that nothing but some
extraordinary chance could save her from whatever might be the
sequel of his suave, possessive manner.&nbsp; The opportunity of
escape was presented to her so suddenly that she couldn&rsquo;t
grasp its significance.&nbsp; She sat there, on the sofa, as
lacking in volition as if the heavy perfume of the place had
drugged her.&nbsp; If she were not drugged or hallucinated it was
strange that Godovius should have left her.&nbsp; A moment of
incredible length passed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t go now .
. .&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; She lifted the heavy
porti&egrave;re.&nbsp; In the passage all was dank and
sepulchrally quiet.&nbsp; She moved swiftly towards the outer
door.&nbsp; A wave of perfume rose to meet her.&nbsp; Then she
found herself running: the white ghost of that low house watching
her from behind . . .</p>
<h2><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the garden of the
moon-flowers down those oblique paths which climbed the
Sab&aelig;an terraces into the blackness of deep kloofs in which
the track could only be felt.&nbsp; She was too overwhelmed by
one fear to take count of any others.&nbsp; In her return she
quite forgot the anxiety and fatigue which had marked her coming
. . . she had almost forgotten James and the reason of her
adventure.&nbsp; At length, not knowing why she did so, she
stopped.&nbsp; Careless of what might be beneath her, she sat
down, pressing her hands to her beating temples, alone in the
middle of Africa.&nbsp; The sense of her solitariness came over
her suddenly.&nbsp; She felt like a child who wakes from a
strange dream in the middle of the night.&nbsp; She had to
convince herself that it was silly to have been frightened.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I lost my head,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was ridiculous of me.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t do to lose
one&rsquo;s head out here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a wonder I kept to
the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; She wished there had been a stream of
water near: one of those little brooks which made her own land
musical: for then she would have bathed her face and pulled
herself together.&nbsp; She felt that if there were any more
terrors to be faced she couldn&rsquo;t cope with them in her
present dishevelled condition.&nbsp; But <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>in all that
forest there was no murmur of water short of the M&rsquo;ssente
River, that tawny, sinister flood which was many miles away, and
which in any case she dared not have approached for fear of
crocodiles; so she contented herself with putting up her fallen
hair and wiping her face with her handkerchief.&nbsp; She only
hoped that while she had been sitting down the siaphu ants had
not got into her petticoats.&nbsp; She rose to her feet, a little
unsteady but now immensely fortified.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I can
manage anything now,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>So she went on her way.&nbsp; The forest was very still, for
whatever winds may have been wandering under the stars were
screened from her by the interwoven tops of the trees.&nbsp; That
there were winds abroad she guessed, for sometimes, in the air
above her, she would hear the sound of a great sighing as the
forest stirred in its sleep.&nbsp; There was one other sound
which troubled her.&nbsp; At first she couldn&rsquo;t be certain
about it; she thought that her disturbed fancy was playing her
tricks; but at length she became convinced that some animal was
moving through the undergrowth parallel with her path.&nbsp; She
stopped to listen, and all was still.&nbsp; She moved on again
and the faint rustling in the leaves returned.&nbsp; She did this
several times.&nbsp; Without doubt she was being followed.&nbsp;
A new pang of terror assailed her.&nbsp; Godovius . . . supposing
that he had actually followed her.&nbsp; Even though his presence
might be in some sense a protection, she would rather have had
anything than that.&nbsp; She argued swiftly with herself.&nbsp;
If it were Godovius, she thought, he would not need to slink
through the forest beside the track; <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>he wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of coming
into the open.&nbsp; Obviously it couldn&rsquo;t be
Godovius.&nbsp; Nor, for that matter, could it be an African,
for, as he had told her, the Waluguru are frightened of the
dark.&nbsp; She decided that it must be an animal.&nbsp; She
thought of the leopard which Godovius had shot; she remembered
hunters&rsquo; tales of the wounded buffalo which will follow a
man for fifty miles, brooding upon a feud which must end with the
death of one of the two.&nbsp; If it were something of that kind
she hoped that the end would come soon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
just go on as if nothing were going to happen.&nbsp; But it will
happen . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened suddenly.&nbsp; A greater rustling disturbed a
patch of tall grasses in a patch of swampy ground a little ahead
of her, and in the path the figure of a man appeared.</p>
<p>One cannot tamper with the portrait.&nbsp; Although it was
never my luck to meet Hare, there must be very few among the
older settlers and hunters and adventurers of equatorial Africa
who have not known him: a sinewy, grave and eminently
characteristic figure that was always to be found stalking
through the gloom of the unknown countries that have opened
before the successive waves of occupation from the south.&nbsp;
The men who went to Rhodesia in 1890 trod in his footsteps.&nbsp;
With the Jameson raiders he lay in Pretoria jail.&nbsp; When the
Uganda Railway was struggling upwards through the thorn-bush
about Tsavo he was shooting lions in the rolling country above
the Athi Plains which is now Nairobi hill.&nbsp; Everybody in <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>central
Africa knew him, not merely the English, but the Belgians, the
Germans, the Portuguese, all of them, from the Zambesi to the
Lorian Swamp.&nbsp; Everybody knew the face of Hare, everybody
knew his fame as a shikari.&nbsp; And that was all; for his soul
was as lonely as the solitudes into which he had so often been
the first to penetrate.&nbsp; You may carry the simile a little
further: it was of the same simplicity and patience and courage,
if a country may be said to possess these attributes of a soul,
and there are some people who think it can.&nbsp; In this
solitude I have known of only one adventurer: and that was Eva
Burwarton.&nbsp; Perhaps there had been one other many years
before.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; At least Hare, that
figure of tragedy, was fortunate in this.&nbsp; And it was thus
they met.&nbsp; You are not to imagine the figure of which the
East African settler will tell you over his sundowner in the New
Stanley.&nbsp; What Eva Burwarton saw upon this strange occasion
was a thin brown man, a scarecrow in the dark wood path, and
liker to a scarecrow because of his arms.&nbsp; The sleeve of one
was empty: the other swung helplessly at his side in spite of the
strips of drab cotton which he had torn from his shirt to keep it
steady.&nbsp; All his clothes were torn: his beard red with the
dust of Africa: his lips and eyelids black with the same dust
caked and encrusted: the skin of face and brow of the colour of
red ochre.&nbsp; The blackened dust on lips and eyelids relieved
the brightness of his teeth and eyes.&nbsp; He was a figure at
the same time savage and bizarre, and as he staggered into the
path he addressed her, as well as his parched tongue <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>would let
him, in a ridiculous attempt at German.&nbsp; He spoke as though
he were drunk or raving.&nbsp; No wonder that she shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ich. . . .&nbsp; Ich. . .&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O . . . nicht . . . frightened sei.&nbsp; Wasser.&nbsp;
Will nicht leiden.&nbsp; Helf mir.&nbsp; Verstehn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t tumbled to it that he was English, as anyone
might have done who knew German.&nbsp; Brilliantly she stumbled
into Swahili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wataka maji. . . .&nbsp; Water.&nbsp; Oh, his
arm&rsquo;s broken. . . .&nbsp; Do lie down . . . you&rsquo;ll
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he fell in the path at her feet.&nbsp; A minute later he
smiled up at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re English?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My apologies.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry to have
frightened you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He still spoke thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were speaking German to me?&nbsp; But you are
English yourself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;A Scotsman.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a moment he could
say no more, and all the time Eva was realising what a pitiable
creature he was, with his torn, dusty face, his empty left sleeve
and the other dangling arm.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, this
alarming introduction had come as a reassurance to both of
them.</p>
<p>At last he spoke: &ldquo;First of all, if you don&rsquo;t
mind, water.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had none for . . . it&rsquo;s
difficult to remember.&nbsp; The arm was ten days ago.&nbsp; If
you can get a little . . . water&rdquo; (it came out like that)
&ldquo;I can manage.&nbsp; You can put it in my hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all her nervousness had gone.&nbsp; The forest, which had
been a horror, became suddenly quite friendly.&nbsp; She took his
greasy hat and walked away <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>into the darkness; and in one of
those poisonous creeks of the swamp she filled it with water that
was as thick as coffee.&nbsp; On her return the black mouth
greeted her with a smile that was altogether charming.</p>
<p>But it was a terrible thing to see him drink the filthy
stuff.&nbsp; &ldquo;You could feel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the
dryness of his throat.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must have seen, for all
the darkness, the pity in her eyes, for he hastened to explain
that matters weren&rsquo;t nearly as bad as they might have
been.&nbsp; &ldquo;The arm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is nothing, a
piece of bad luck.&nbsp; Time will mend it.&nbsp; But unless you
are in some way a prodigy it is something of a handicap to have
to do without hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the position had been
desperately serious, and he wasn&rsquo;t much of a hand at
joking, he wanted to make a joke of it.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
know much about women . . . that sort of woman at any rate; and
this made him unusually anxious to be gentle with her.&nbsp;
Besides, a man who is on the point of dying with thirst in the
middle of Africa at night does not expect to fall in with a woman
walking hatless and unarmed.&nbsp; He knew that something unusual
was doing; he knew that she too was in trouble.&nbsp; And
obviously he was going to help her.&nbsp; In the middle of Africa
people help one another without asking questions: in their
relations there appears a certain delicacy which sits
particularly well on such a villainous-looking person as Hare was
then.&nbsp; So he asked her nothing of herself.&nbsp; In a moment
or two, his strength reviving, according to its obstinate wont,
like that of a cut flower that had been given water, he sat up in
<a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the
path.&nbsp; She glowed to see him better; two sick men would have
been rather a large order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the M&rsquo;ssente Swamp?&rdquo; he asked at
length.&nbsp; She answered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the M&rsquo;ssente runs into the Ruwu.&nbsp; Yes. .
. .&nbsp; We&rsquo;re about a hundred miles from the
railway.&nbsp; Up above there are rubber plantations.&nbsp;
Yours, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him that they belonged to a German, Godovius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godovius?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried &ldquo;Sakharani.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have it,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course.&nbsp; A Jew.&nbsp; I know all about Mr. Godovius. . .
.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard from the Masai.&nbsp; Sakharani. . .
.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And you are living on his estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She denied it hastily.&nbsp; There was a hint of pity in his
question.&nbsp; All the time she was conscious of the scrutiny of
his eyes from within their dark circles.&nbsp; She told him that
she came from the Luguru mission, a mile or two away, and that
her brother was there.&nbsp; She told him their name.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;A minister?&rdquo; as though he were uncertain
whether the information suited his plans.&nbsp; It was ludicrous
that a man in this extremity should pick and choose his host.</p>
<p>There followed a long silence.&nbsp; At last he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I think I can manage.&nbsp; I mean I think I can
walk as far as the mission.&nbsp; But I want to put the case to
you, Miss Burwarton, for it&rsquo;s possible under the
circumstances that you won&rsquo;t like me to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;Whatever the circumstances were,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let you go.&rdquo;&nbsp; She meant that
ordinary humanity wouldn&rsquo;t let her turn him away; but I
suspect that she was clutching also at the shadow of a strong man
in him, because his gentleness had shown her already that he
could help her.&nbsp; She could not have abandoned him if only
for that reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be hasty . . . you shall
judge,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be perfectly frank
with you and I shall expect you to be the same with me.&nbsp; My
name is Hare.&nbsp; If you had been longer in this country
you&rsquo;d have heard of me; and you wouldn&rsquo;t have heard
much good.&nbsp; A fellow who makes his living as I do is not
usually an exemplary person.&nbsp; No doubt a lady would be
shocked by my way of living.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any, so
that is no odds to me.&nbsp; When your neighbour Godovius hears
that I was here, and probably he will hear sooner or later, I
shall find myself clapped into jail at Dar-es-Salaam.&nbsp; If
only I had the use of my hands I could get out of this
country.&nbsp; In B. E. A. they know me well enough.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for anything I&rsquo;m more
than usually ashamed of.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ivory poaching.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never been a great believer in any game laws: and
particularly German ones.&nbsp; But I realise that I&rsquo;m done
. . . more or less.&nbsp; There are only two alternatives: to
shelter with you at Luguru and fight it out, or to throw in my
hand on Godovius&rsquo;s doorstep.&nbsp; In either case I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t starve: but the Germans have a long score to
settle with me, and I doubt if they&rsquo;ll kill any fatted
calves when they get me.&nbsp; The other is a fair sporting
chance.&nbsp; If your brother can <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>find it in accordance with his
conscience to aid and abet a felon. . . .&nbsp; Well . . .
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But already she was convinced that the felon was a man that
she could trust.&nbsp; I think she would have trusted him if the
crimes to which he had confessed had included a murder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever it had been,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t have thrown him over.&nbsp; It was so pathetic to
see such a strong, hard man as that absolutely beaten.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t have been fair.&nbsp; And I felt . . . I knew . .
. that he had been somehow sent to help me.&rdquo; (She
wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of the words.) &ldquo;Even then I knew
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps she did.&nbsp; I think most of the things which Eva
Burwarton did were dictated to her by instinct rather than
reason: but there was another factor which she possibly
discounted, or did not realise, and this was the knowledge that
this man too was an enemy of Godovius.&nbsp; It struck her that
they were both in the same boat.</p>
<p>As for James . . . whatever James might think&mdash;and it was
quite possible that he wouldn&rsquo;t countenance the protection
of a man who was &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; by the German authorities
as a matter of principle, if not for the protection of the
mission&rsquo;s name&mdash;whatever James might think, she had
determined to take this man and to hide him.&nbsp; After what had
happened that night she felt that she couldn&rsquo;t take any
risks of being left alone to deal with Godovius.&nbsp; For all
she knew, James might be dead by the time she returned; and the
mere presence of another man of kindred race had made her a
little easier.&nbsp; It is in the way of a <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>compliment
to our race that she had so quickly decided that she could trust
a gaunt and battered wreck of an adventurer&mdash;for that is
what it came to&mdash;just because he was British.&nbsp; She
clung to the happy chance of their meeting as if it were indeed
her salvation.&nbsp; And she wanted from the first to tell him
all her story, as a child might do to any stranger who
sympathised with its loneliness.&nbsp; That was why she
couldn&rsquo;t answer him at first.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know
where to begin.</p>
<p>He mistook the causes of her hesitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
well then,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I quite understand.&nbsp;
I can shift for myself.&nbsp; And I am grateful for your
kindness.&nbsp; I had no right to ask for more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer she burst into tears.&nbsp; That was what she had
been waiting for all the time since she had run out of
Godovius&rsquo;s room, and the sudden sense of relief which his
presence implied quite overwhelmed her.&nbsp; She was ashamed of
her crying; but she couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Through her
tears she saw the ragged figure of Hare, squatting in the dark
path and infinitely more embarrassed by this storm of feeling
than herself.&nbsp; Indeed it was a strange setting for their
first meeting.&nbsp; Under the same atmosphere of stress, within
the same utter solitudes these two met and parted.&nbsp; In after
time Eva always remembered this moment with a peculiar
tenderness.&nbsp; Perhaps Hare remembers too.</p>
<p>At last she dried her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you sure you can manage two miles? . . .&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think it can be more.&nbsp; We will go slowly.&nbsp;
And I will take your rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>And
though he protested, partly because he would not have her
burdened, and partly because it offended his instinct to be for a
moment unarmed, she slipped the strap of the Mannlicher from his
shoulders, guiding it gently over his helpless right arm.&nbsp;
Her tears had so steadied her that she acted without any
hesitation.&nbsp; It is not strange that Hare wondered at
her.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>When she thought about it in after times it often struck her
as strange that she found herself equipped with a regular plan of
concealment for the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had never had to
hide anything before in my life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and yet
long before we got to the mission I knew exactly where I should
have to put him: I&rsquo;d even thought about his food, and
bandages for his poor arm, and water for him to wash in.&nbsp; It
was funny: it all came to me naturally.&nbsp; I suppose
concealment and scheming of that kind are more natural to a woman
than to a man.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t ever have believed that I
was so deceitful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of those first strange days she would always speak without
reserve.&nbsp; I suppose that it is always a happiness for people
to remember the beginnings of a relationship of that kind: and to
have mothered a man who was so utterly helpless as Hare in
secret, and to have shielded him from a positive danger, brought
into her life a spice of romance which was hardly to be found in
her daily endeavours to preserve the constitution of James from
the menace of draughts or <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>damp sheets.&nbsp; In those days she
was very happy, and, above all, never lonely.&nbsp; Apart from
any other appeal, the situation aroused her imagination.&nbsp; In
this most serious business she was playing, just as she had
played at houses when she was quite a little girl.&nbsp; And I am
certain that she never once thought of the possibility of a
passion more profound arising from her play.</p>
<p>It was in the inner chamber of her little <i>banda</i> in the
garden that she had decided to place Hare.&nbsp; She felt that
here, in the company of Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s whisky bottles, he
would be reasonably safe; for the outer of the two rooms had
always been sacred to her, and even the boy Hamisi never entered
it.&nbsp; She knew that she could feed him there.&nbsp; In that
country food need never be a serious problem, and after sunset
she could always be sure of freedom from observation.&nbsp; If
once she could make Hare comfortable she felt sure that all would
be well.&nbsp; That night, indeed, she left him alone with a
gourd full of milk and a plate of mealie meal porridge.&nbsp; He
begged her not to worry about him, saying that he had often slept
in rougher places than this.&nbsp; With his clasp-knife she
unfastened two of the bales of sisal fibre, which she spread upon
the floor for bedding.&nbsp; A third bale of the white silky
stuff served him for pillow.&nbsp; He assured her that he wanted
no more . . . or rather only one thing more: the loaded rifle
which she had been carrying and which he could not bear to sleep
without.&nbsp; &ldquo;You could not use it without any
hands,&rdquo; she said, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>have
it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you do not know how undefended I
am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she laid it by his side.</p>
<p>Returning to the house, she found the boy Onyango sleeping on
the floor at the foot of James&rsquo;s bed, and James too
sleeping so quietly and with such gently stirring breath that she
began to wonder why she had ever been frightened or embarked on
her amazing expedition to the house of Godovius.&nbsp; She saw
now that Godovius had been right when he had said that there was
nothing to worry about, that nothing terrible would have happened
if she had stayed at home and never suffered any of the nightmare
from which she was just emerging.&nbsp; The stark reality of that
little room, the figures of the two sleepers, the symbolical
pictures and texts on the walls, the glass of milk at
James&rsquo;s bedside, recalled her with a variety of appeals to
a normal world untroubled by vast emotional experience, and the
shadow of the other world huge and fantastic faded from her mind
until there was only one vestige of it left: the vision of a
gaunt man with an empty sleeve and another broken arm lying
asleep on the sisal in Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; It
was just as though this fragment of a dream had materialised and
become fantastically embodied in the texture of common life.</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, she suddenly realised that for some
moments her eyes had been interested in watching a big black
Culex mosquito which had swooped down from the white mosquito-net
upon the transparent arm which James in his restlessness had
slipped beneath its edge.&nbsp; And this awakened her.&nbsp; <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>She roused
the faithless watchman Onyango and sent him back to his
shed.&nbsp; Then she tenderly replaced that pitiable arm of James
beneath the shelter of his net.&nbsp; The slight movement roused
him.&nbsp; He opened his eyes and stared at her lazily, without
speaking.&nbsp; She became suddenly conscious of her own
appearance.&nbsp; It seemed to her that all her night&rsquo;s
experience, even the secret of Hare&rsquo;s concealment, must be
written in her face.&nbsp; But the wondering eyes of James saw
nothing.&nbsp; He, too, was returning from a strange land.</p>
<p>At last he spoke: &ldquo;Is it night, Eva?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; she didn&rsquo;t want him to
look at her like that, and so with her hand she smoothed back the
lank hair from his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have been dreaming,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And
then, again: &ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to consider before she answered him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s . . . it&rsquo;s Saturday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday. . . .&nbsp; Saturday. . . .&nbsp; To-morrow
will be Sunday.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know. . . .&nbsp; I seem to
have missed two days.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to understand now,&rdquo; she begged
him.</p>
<p>He was wonderfully mild.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try to understand.&nbsp; It does hurt
rather.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m awfully thirsty too.&nbsp; And I want to
tell you about my dream.&nbsp; A peculiar dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a cupful of milk, which he drank eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday morning,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
Sunday to-morrow.&nbsp; That means that I shall have to be better
by then.&nbsp; But to have dropped two days, two whole <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>days.&nbsp;
Where have I been during those two days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Literally, as one answers a child without thinking, she told
him that he had been in that room and on that bed; and, curiously
enough, her answer seemed to satisfy him.&nbsp; Then suddenly he
started to laugh in a feeble, helpless way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dream,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while I remember it;
for you were in it; we were both of us in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
told her how he had dreamed that they were walking together on a
Sunday afternoon in the country to the west of Far Forest.&nbsp;
A beautiful day, and they were going hand in hand, as they used
to do when they were children.&nbsp; The road along which they
moved was a grass-grown track which had once been used by the
Romans.&nbsp; That afternoon it was full of people; but all the
people were moving in the opposite direction, so that at last he
had begun to think that they were going the wrong way.&nbsp; So
he had stopped an old man with a white beard who was running back
as hard as he could go, and asked him if they were on the right
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are on the
right road.&nbsp; But can you guess what the end will
be?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then suddenly, as he caught sight of
James&rsquo;s face, he had made a gesture of terror and rushed
away.&nbsp; James would have stopped others of that running
stream of people, but as soon as they saw him they covered their
eyes and ran.&nbsp; &ldquo;And although they were sometimes near
enough to brush us as they passed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was
just as if the whole thing were going on many miles away, and we
were watching them from a distance: just as if they were in a <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>different
world or in a different patch of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last they
had come to a little crest (Eva knew it well) where the green
lane falls to a valley through the slant of a grove of
beeches.&nbsp; All the time the moving stream of people with
averted faces never ceased, and at the bottom of the hill, where,
in reality, the grass lane cuts down beside a stream into a piece
of woodland, a sudden change came over the scene.&nbsp; It was
night.&nbsp; People were brushing past them in the
darkness.&nbsp; And instead of Shropshire it was Africa; he could
have been sure of that from the peculiar aromatic odour of
brushwood in the air.&nbsp; Between the branches of the trees
above the stream a new moon was shining: an African moon all the
wrong way round.&nbsp; Perhaps Eva had never noticed that the
moon was the wrong way round in Africa?&nbsp; A man whispered as
he passed them: &ldquo;Hurry up, or you&rsquo;ll be too late for
the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; They hurried on.&nbsp; There was no sound
in the wood but a crooning of pigeons.&nbsp; In a clearing there
stood a little church of galvanised iron of the same shape and
size as the mission church at Luguru.&nbsp; However it had got
there James could not imagine.&nbsp; It never used to be
there.&nbsp; From the narrow doors of this church people were
pouring in a steady stream like the sand in an egg-boiler.&nbsp;
Both he and Eva were hot and tired, but they pressed on: for they
felt that after all they might not be in time: and when they came
to the door the stream of people, who covered their eyes, divided
on either side of them, so that they could easily have
entered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t get you to go
in,&rdquo; said James.&nbsp; &ldquo;You told me that you <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at it.&nbsp; So I went in
myself.&nbsp; A funny thing: the church smelt of Africans; it
smelt like a Waluguru hut.&nbsp; And it was empty.&nbsp; Except
for one man.&nbsp; And he was a European in black clothes&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t see his face, for his head lolled over.&nbsp; He
was stretched out on the front of the pulpit, hung there with big
nails through his hands.&nbsp; I called to you; but as I shouted
it went dark.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had a dream like that
before.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t like me to dream.&nbsp; What tricks
fever will play with a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the time she had scarcely been listening to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll dream again,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; She knew that this sort of extravagance was not good
for James.&nbsp; Still, it was better that he should be talking
excited rubbish than lying there unconscious.&nbsp; She tried to
make him comfortable with a sponge wrung out in water and
eau-de-Cologne.&nbsp; While she was sponging him he still wanted
to go on talking; but she knew that it would be wiser not to
encourage him, and a little later he fell asleep.</p>
<p>She left him: tired as she was, she knew that it was no use
trying to sleep herself.&nbsp; She went out on to the stoep and
sat there in faint moonlight under the watery sky.&nbsp; The
night was chilly and she wrapped herself in a blanket, and sat
there, thinking of that strange night and of the doubtful future
until the black sky grew grey and birds began to sing in some
faint emulation of the chorus of temperate dawns.&nbsp; She
listened to them for a little while, and then, sighing, with
fatigue, but strangely happy, went into the house.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>She
could not tell how long she had sat there.&nbsp; It must have
been several hours at least, for a heavy dew had drenched the
blanket which she had wrapped round her.</p>
<h2><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> it was far too light for her to
think of sleep, and so she went into the house to change her
clothes and to make herself clean.&nbsp; When she saw her own
reflection in the little mirror she was shocked, for it seemed to
her a strange thing that she should have passed through so many
hours of intense experience and show so little for it.&nbsp; Her
blouse was torn and her skirt caked with black mud, but that was
all.&nbsp; She would not have been surprised if she had found
that her hair had turned white.&nbsp; But it hadn&rsquo;t: only,
when she took it down, she was puzzled for a moment by an
unfamiliar perfume which seemed to have been imprisoned in its
folds.&nbsp; She shuddered, realising all at once that it was the
scent of Godovius&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; But when she had bathed and
changed her clothes and stepped out into the summery sunshine of
early morning she felt as though she had really managed to wash
that damnable atmosphere away.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t really a
vestige of it left.&nbsp; She just felt a little light-headed and
nervous, as if her legs didn&rsquo;t quite belong to her.&nbsp;
But she did realise that she had got her hands full.</p>
<p>In the first place, James.&nbsp; Several times she passed in
and out of his room.&nbsp; He was still sleeping peacefully, and
she did not disturb him; but somewhere <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>about nine
o&rsquo;clock, when she had breakfasted, she found that he had
wakened.&nbsp; He was lying on his back with his arms folded in
front of his chest and his eyes wide open.&nbsp; He smiled at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a funny time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was unfeignedly thankful.&nbsp; She washed him tenderly,
and from time to time he asked her short questions which she
thought it her duty to evade for fear of exciting him.&nbsp; And
he was easily satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been up all night with
me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a strange night.&nbsp;
Did I talk to you in the night?&nbsp; I seem to remember . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me a silly nightmare,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that was all.&nbsp; You had been dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always
dreaming.&nbsp; Even when I&rsquo;m awake.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember anything about it.&nbsp; Everything at Luguru is like a
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she left him for a little.&nbsp; She had begun to
wonder about her hidden guest.&nbsp; Now for the first time, in
broad daylight, and removed from all the romantic circumstances
of the night before, she realised the results of her
hospitality.&nbsp; The possibilities were frightening.&nbsp; A
law-abiding citizen, she was sheltering a felon; a modest young
woman, she was hiding a strange man of whom she knew nothing at
all.&nbsp; But there was no running away from it.&nbsp; She had
taken on the job and must see it through.&nbsp; That was the way
in which she looked at it, even in the face of a considerable
anxiety.&nbsp; It struck her as strange that she hadn&rsquo;t for
a moment counted the <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>cost the night before.&nbsp; She
smiled at herself, a little indulgently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always do
things like that and think about them afterwards,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she had a great deal to be thankful for in the
recovery of James.&nbsp; Freed of this anxiety, she was far more
capable of tackling the problem which Hare presented.&nbsp;
Godovius was her other concern, and it seemed to her providential
that things had really come to a head at Njumba ja Mweze that
night, for after what had happened there he couldn&rsquo;t very
well pursue his attentions.&nbsp; She was thinking all the time
of Godovius as a possible threat to her two
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.&nbsp; For the sake of both of them it was
essential that he should be kept away from Luguru.&nbsp; Nothing
could have happened better.&nbsp; Now he couldn&rsquo;t have the
face to come.&nbsp; That was all she knew about Godovius.</p>
<p>In this way, scheming for his protection, searching for every
probable contingency which might threaten his safety, and arming
herself against them with an unusual caution, she came to Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; It was now midday and very
hot.&nbsp; Close to the <i>banda</i>, dangerously close, the
shamba boys were cutting down the poles on which the sisal spires
had withered.&nbsp; They hacked at the pulpy poles with iron
<i>pangas</i>, and sang to each other a queer antiphonal song
which had lightened the labours of black men cutting wood for
untold generations.&nbsp; Hamisi had climbed up the pole, and
when the trunk was nearly severed he swung himself to and fro
until the whole thing toppled over with a tearing sound.&nbsp;
When the pole fell they shouted to one another and laughed; and
one <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>of
them, a naked M&rsquo;luguru who had sat in the garden path
busily excavating a jigger from his toe, looked up and laughed
too, as though the occasion were one for universal
happiness.&nbsp; He was an ugly creature with shining cicatrices
on either cheek and porcupine quills which he had picked up stuck
through his hair, and as soon as he had done with his surgery he
jumped to his feet and lolled up against the side of the
<i>banda</i>.</p>
<p>It suddenly came to Eva that only the thin grass wall of the
<i>banda</i> now separated him from the place where Hare was
lying.&nbsp; Already her secret seemed on the point of being
discovered.&nbsp; She remembered hearing Godovius tell her
brother one day that the Waluguru, in common with other African
races, could detect the presence of a white man by his
smell.&nbsp; She was so frightened that she hurried to the side
of the <i>banda</i> and pulled the lounging Luguru away.&nbsp; It
was the first time in her life that she had handled a native
roughly.&nbsp; The others, standing idle in their dirty red
blankets, laughed.&nbsp; She felt that they were jeering at her;
but if she had laid open their comrade&rsquo;s back with the cut
of a <i>kiboko</i> they would have laughed in the same way.&nbsp;
She called Hamisi, and told him to see to the other side of the
hedge first.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;N&rsquo;dio, Bibi,&rdquo; and
smiled.&nbsp; She hated all their smiling.&nbsp; He was smiling,
she thought, at her secret.&nbsp; Probably they all knew it by
now.&nbsp; Soon Godovius would know . . .</p>
<p>The boys moved off to the other end of the garden and still
she stood at the corner of the <i>banda</i> <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>thinking.&nbsp; Around her the lazy life of the morning
stirred.&nbsp; Among the aromatic herbs which had invaded that
neglected garden with their ashen foliage and clustered flowers,
purple and cinnabar, the restless butterflies of Africa hovered
in mazy flight.&nbsp; Most of them were small and barred with
cinnabar, like the little orange tips which brightened the
Shropshire lanes in spring.&nbsp; A green lizard moved as quietly
as a shadow at her feet.&nbsp; Through the green curtain of
acacia a flight of honey-suckers passed with a whir of
wings.&nbsp; She hated all this busy, mocking life, this land
that smiled eternally and was eternally cruel.&nbsp; She felt
that she had no part in it.&nbsp; It was all wrong.</p>
<p>She went into her <i>banda</i> and tapped at the
partition.&nbsp; Hare answered her in a whisper.&nbsp; He said
that he was quite comfortable.&nbsp; He had slept and was not
hungry.&nbsp; All that morning he had lain listening to the
chatter of the boys as they worked on the sisal hedge, and he had
heard many curious things of which they would never have spoken
if they had known that he was there.&nbsp; He wanted to know all
about James, and seemed relieved when she told him of his calm
awakening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now he should be all right,&rdquo; he
said, and told her what to do in the matter of food and of
quinine.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you sound tired,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must rest yourself.&nbsp; The night of quiet and
comfort has made all the difference to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;m an anxiety to you; and you have enough to worry about
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although this was almost an echo of her own thought, she
denied it hastily.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&ldquo;Ah, but I need not be an anxiety much
longer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A day or two and I shall be
able to fend for myself.&nbsp; I could hear that you were nervous
when you spoke to the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to explain herself; for suddenly, thinking of what
life at Luguru would be like if he left her, she realised what
the presence of the fugitive meant to her.&nbsp; But this was no
time for talking, even in whispers.&nbsp; After sunset, when the
Africans had gone to sleep. . . .&nbsp; She asked him if there
was anything that he needed particularly.&nbsp; He told her that
he only wanted two things, water to wash in and a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t use either of them,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;as you are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard him laugh softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
how clever I am with no hands to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved away softly, and a little later she returned,
bringing with her a gourd full of water, soap and a towel, and
the pencil for which he had asked her.&nbsp; Very carefully she
moved aside the partition and pushed them inside.&nbsp; But she
did not see him, for the inside of the <i>banda</i> was dark and
the sound of a step on the garden path made her close the open
space hurriedly.&nbsp; And even though she found that her fancy
had deceived her, this sort of thing was not over-good for her
nerves.</p>
<h2><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>II</h2>
<p>In this manner, all through that day which was the first and
the most trying, she hovered between her two anxieties.&nbsp;
James was more than usually difficult and talkative.&nbsp; With
the vanishing of his fever it seemed as if all the accumulated
nervous energy which disease had beneficently drugged were
suddenly released.&nbsp; He prayed aloud; he made plans, and in
the intervals he would call to Eva to remind her of some small
thing that had happened at Far Forest many years before.&nbsp; It
was all encouraging in a way, but tiring . . . very tiring.&nbsp;
In the evening, about the time of sunset, he fell asleep over his
Bible, and the relief to Eva was as great as if he had been
delirious all day.</p>
<p>She sat on the stoep in that sudden interval of silence and
relief, watching the hot sky grow cool and temperate, watching, a
little later, the growing crescent of the young moon free itself
from the topmost tangles of the forest and then go sailing, as if
indeed it had been caught and were now released into a dusky
sky.&nbsp; Almost before she had realised that the light was
failing, it was night.&nbsp; The crescent now was soaring through
the crowns of her own tall crotons.&nbsp; From every grassy
nullah where water once had flowed the frogs began their
trilling.&nbsp; She wondered if she would ever taste the long
coolness of twilight again.</p>
<p>Then, when she had made a small meal and put aside some food
for Hare, she lit a blizzard lantern <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and carried it to her
<i>banda</i>.&nbsp; From the other end of the compound, where the
Africans slept, she heard the twanging of a strange
instrument.&nbsp; One of the boys was singing an interminable,
tuneless native song.&nbsp; At any rate they were safe for the
night.</p>
<p>Hare was waiting for her.&nbsp; She placed the lantern on her
own side of the partition, so that only a wide panel of light
fell within the inner chamber.&nbsp; He was sitting up on his bed
of sisal fibre, making a savage but intensely pathetic
figure.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose he knew for one moment what a
ruffian he looked.&nbsp; For many years he had lived a life in
which one does not consider appearances, but, for all that, he
had tried to make himself as clean as he could with one imperfect
hand.&nbsp; He had combed his long hair and even attempted to
make a job of his beard.&nbsp; This was really the first time
that Eva had properly seen him.&nbsp; The night before, in spite
of his exhaustion, he had seemed so collected and capable, so
eager not to make trouble, and she had been so anxious about
James and distressed by the difficulty of the situation that she
hadn&rsquo;t quite taken in his absolute helplessness.&nbsp; It
came to her in a sudden flash of realisation.&nbsp; She felt
guilty and ashamed.&nbsp; Her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am much more comfortable,&rdquo; he said, making
matters worse than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how on earth have you managed?&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your poor arm. . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
neglected you shockingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once she became maternal and practical.&nbsp; It was
not very difficult for her.&nbsp; For the greater part <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>of her life
she had been looking after helpless male creatures: first her old
father and then James.&nbsp; Now she would not be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the arm broken?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>It was nothing, he said, only a smashed collar-bone.&nbsp; It
had been broken before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only, you see, I must keep
the upper arm close to the side.&nbsp; It acts as a sort of
splint.&nbsp; In a fortnight it will be sound.&nbsp; I know all
about this sort of thing.&nbsp; I have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wash you, anyway,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>I do not suppose such a thing as this had ever happened to
Hare in all his life; but now he was too helpless and the idea
too reasonable for him to protest.&nbsp; To Eva the business came
quite naturally.&nbsp; Very tenderly she disentangled the dirty
shirt of khaki drill from his left shoulder, slipping the sleeve
over the poor pointed stump of what had once been one of the
wiriest arms in Africa.&nbsp; It was a painful process to her;
all the time she felt that she was hurting him; but he smiled up
at her with a look of confidence and shyness which one might more
easily have seen on the face of a child than of this old
hunter.</p>
<p>The shirt was dirty . . . horribly dirty; but he made no
apologies which might have embarrassed them both.&nbsp; The
injured shoulder was more difficult.&nbsp; Pain twisted his lips
into a sort of smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Easy . . . if you don&rsquo;t
mind,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my slitting up the
sleeve,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my
only shirt.&nbsp; <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>It&rsquo;s only dirty because of this accident.&nbsp; I
generally wash it every few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last it was over.&nbsp; Now she could see the angle of the
broken collar-bone, and from it a great bruise, purple and
yellow, tracking down into the axilla.&nbsp; She washed him,
passing gently over the bruised area.&nbsp; When she had finished
he thanked her.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not a woman&rsquo;s
work,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it is,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am wrong.&nbsp; It is many years since I have
spoken to a woman.&nbsp; I live a very solitary life.&nbsp; Even
before I had the misfortune to lose my arm.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
funny to see how his little self-consciousness showed itself.</p>
<p>Now she was anxious to rescue his very awful shirt; for she
had decided that it would be easy to fit him out in one of
James&rsquo;s until it was clean.&nbsp; He was almost as anxious
about that as he had been about the rifle.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
want to offend her; but for all his gentleness he was determined
to get it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must wash it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have it, but . . . did you notice that
there&rsquo;s a big pocket in the left breast?&nbsp; Yes . . .
that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Will you be kind enough to look in
it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a wee packet of papers in a waterproof
cover.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very near
the only thing in my gear that I&rsquo;ve saved.&nbsp; It has
only a personal value.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and then modestly
added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fruits of several adventurous
years.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a book&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>He
looked at her very narrowly.&nbsp; She could see now that his
eyes were of a very clear blue-grey.&nbsp; In the lamplight they
sparkled like the eyes of a bird.&nbsp; Then he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are the
first human being I have ever told that to . . . and there
aren&rsquo;t many . . . who would not have thought it rather a
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would be ridiculous,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For I don&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp; When I come to think of
it, I don&rsquo;t even know your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m called Hare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Charles
Hare.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s possible you&rsquo;ve heard the
name.&nbsp; Not probable you&rsquo;ve heard any good of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It sounded as if he were trying to make the best
of it himself.</p>
<p>She repeated: &ldquo;Charles Hare.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he
heard the words in her voice his incorrigible romanticism
wouldn&rsquo;t permit him to let them pass.&nbsp; It was like
Hare to abandon in one moment an alias that he had carried for a
quarter of a century.&nbsp; I suppose it was just the directness
and simplicity of Eva that worked the miracle: it suddenly
occurred to him that it would be a shame to deceive her in the
least particular.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can forget that name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s none the
better for my having carried it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know&rdquo;&mdash;there was a bright challenge in his
eyes&mdash;&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s really much worse.&nbsp; But it
isn&rsquo;t mine.&nbsp; My name is M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; Hector
M&lsquo;Crae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was bewildered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why&mdash;&rdquo; she
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had sufficient reasons for losing it,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
found a lot of things during the last four days.&nbsp; You must
forgive me for having deceived you.&nbsp; One gets into the habit
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded rather a lame finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
long story.&nbsp; Some day if you&rsquo;ll listen to me
I&rsquo;ll tell it to you.&nbsp; Now, if you please, we&rsquo;ll
leave it.&nbsp; I want to know about your brother.&nbsp; I should
like to know a little about you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to question her narrowly on the subject of James,
approving, with monosyllables, what she had done.&nbsp; And then
he told her seriously that she was looking over-tired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You want sleep,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
mustn&rsquo;t talk any more to-night.&nbsp; Will you throw this
blanket over my shoulders?&nbsp; Oh . . . and there&rsquo;s one
thing more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been clumsy enough to break the
point of your pencil.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a knife on my
belt.&nbsp; Will you sharpen it for me?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was four nights later that M&lsquo;Crae&mdash;it is better
to call him M&lsquo;Crae, if it were only to dissociate this new
being from the figure which so many people in Africa
know&mdash;came to his story.&nbsp; Eva had never asked for it;
and I think this delicacy on her part did something towards
making him feel that it was her due.&nbsp; Besides this, the
passage of time had made an intimacy between the two more
easy.&nbsp; For one thing, James suffered no return of his fever:
Eva was less harassed and for that reason more able to devote <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>herself to
the other invalid.&nbsp; She had made it clear to him, once and
for all, that a man with one hand, and that in a sling, was in no
position to look after himself.&nbsp; At first, no doubt, his
native pride, of which he had more than a man&rsquo;s ordinary
share, and which had been fostered alike by his infirmity and his
solitary manner of life, made it difficult for him to accept her
attentions with ease; but by degrees the naturalness and the
simplicity of her outlook overcame him.&nbsp; Perhaps this was
not so strange as one might imagine, for the man&rsquo;s
independence was more a matter of habit than of instinct.&nbsp;
Her deftness and her tenderness together made it impossible to
resist even if he would have done so.&nbsp; And her beauty . . .
I do not know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I want to know.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was in love with her from the beginning.&nbsp; If he
were, I can only believe that it was a great blessing to him: the
very crown and fulfilment of a strangely romantic life.</p>
<p>On the fourth evening he had evidently prepared himself for
his recitation.&nbsp; He would not talk of other things.&nbsp;
Eva couldn&rsquo;t understand it at first: for he answered her
questions as though he were not in the least interested, and she
thought that for some queer reason of his own he was sulking, or
perhaps that he was in pain.&nbsp; I suppose he was in
pain.&nbsp; It was not an easy matter for a man like M&lsquo;Crae
to get a story off his chest.&nbsp; She had hung the blizzard
lamp at the mouth of the <i>banda</i> and she was sitting in a
deck-chair close to the partition, where it was so dark that
neither of them could see the other&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>was just
conscious of his eyes in the darkness, and it seemed to her that
they never left her face.&nbsp; It was a very quiet, moonless
night.&nbsp; For some reason the sky was unusually cloudy.&nbsp;
The noises of the dark, the zizzing of cicalas and the trilling
of frogs were so regular that they became as unnoticeable as
silence.&nbsp; In the roof little lizards were moving; but they,
too, came and went as softly as shadows.&nbsp; No violence
troubled their isolation, unless it were the impact of an
occasional moth hurling out of the darkness at the
lantern&rsquo;s flame or the very distant howling of a hyena on
the edge of the forest.&nbsp; It was a silence that invited
confidences.&nbsp; No two people in the world could have been
more alone.</p>
<p>At length Eva asked: &ldquo;Mr. M&lsquo;Crae, what&rsquo;s the
matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there followed
another long silence.</p>
<p>Then, without a word of introduction, he began talking to her
about his childhood.&nbsp; A long and disordered story.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t seem to be considering her at all in the
recitation.&nbsp; She might not even have been there, she
thought, if it had not been that his eyes were always on
her.&nbsp; It was a remote and savage story, which began in the
island of Arran, fifty years ago: a small farm of stone in the
mountain above Kilmory Water, dreaming above a waste of sea in
which, at night, the lighthouse on the Isle of Pladda shows the
only token of life.&nbsp; But by day all the mouth of the firth
to Ailsa Craig would be streaked with the smoke of steamers
making for the <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>Clyde, and others reaching out from those grey waters
to the ends of the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for the shipping,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might have lived all
my life at the Clachan and never known that there was anything
else in the world.&nbsp; I should be living there now.&nbsp; Let
me see . . . July. . . .&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be over-early for the
heather.&nbsp; I can see my father there now.&nbsp; But he must
be dead for all that.&nbsp; When I left him he was a strong man
of sixty without a single grey hair to his head.&nbsp; Strong. .
. .&nbsp; Ay, and just.&nbsp; But hard.&nbsp; Hard as
granite.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t judge him harshly.&nbsp; I often
see, now that I&rsquo;m not so young as I was, that if I had
stayed in Arran, as my brothers did, I might have grown into
something very like him.&nbsp; Sometimes I catch myself in a
gesture or even a turn of speech which is him to the life.&nbsp;
That is the outside of me.&nbsp; All the battering about the
world I&rsquo;ve had hasn&rsquo;t been enough to get rid of the
externals.&nbsp; Inside it&rsquo;s very different.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s eyes never saw farther than the firth or the
sound; his life kept inside the Old Testament, while I&rsquo;ve
seen more of the world than most people, and played skittles with
the Ten Commandments too.&nbsp; Understand that I&rsquo;m not
sorry for it.&nbsp; There aren&rsquo;t many regrets in my life. .
. .&nbsp; Just a few.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve missed things that are a
consolation when a man grows old . . . a home . . . children . .
. but I believe the balance is on my side.&nbsp; They taught me
the whole duty of man in a thing they call the Shorter
Catechism.&nbsp; They would say that I&rsquo;ve failed in
it.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s more than one way <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>of
glorifying God, and there are more gods than the God of my
fathers . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sixteen when his mother died, and her loss had
desolated him.&nbsp; He was only a boy, but he saw already that
life at the Clachan must resolve itself into a struggle between
the two strongest wills within its walls, his own and his
father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If he had lived in some inland valley it is
possible that he would have found no way of escape, even though
the most inland Scotsmen have a way of escaping.&nbsp; As it was,
his prison, however remote it may have seemed, overlooked one of
the great highways of the world, and escape was easy.&nbsp; He
left Lamlash one day in a ketch-rigged, round-bottomed barge that
was sailing for Glasgow, and from that day forward he never saw
his home again.&nbsp; Sometimes, he said, he had felt a sudden
impulse to return.&nbsp; He had a little theory of his own that
for a man to be completely satisfied he must see every place that
he has visited at least twice; no more than twice; for the first
return was an inevitable disillusionment, the only cure, in fact,
for the wanderer&rsquo;s hunger.&nbsp; Once indeed, in the early
years of his sea-faring, he had returned to the port of Glasgow
in the stokehold of a cattle ship rolling over from Brazil.&nbsp;
He had been talking to the third engineer, whose home was a
village called Kirn, on the Holy Loch; and this man, who glowed
with anticipation at the thought of nearing home, had promised to
call him when they should draw abeam of the Pladda light.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A sight for sair eyes,&rdquo; he had called it, and
M&lsquo;Crae had half persuaded himself that <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>he was
going to share in this tender emotion.&nbsp; It was three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the good-natured engineer
shouted to him as he toiled, sweating and stripped to the waist,
before the fires.&nbsp; He had thrown a shirt over his shoulders
and climbed up the iron ladder of the engine-room, where the
pistons sighed and panted, to the dark deck.&nbsp; It was a
pitchy night, the sky full of a howling wind and cold flurries of
snow.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;tween-decks sea-sick cattle were
stamping and making hideous noises.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see
the light of Pladda over on the port bow,&rdquo; the third had
shouted, and the word &ldquo;bow&rdquo; was caught in the tail of
the wind and borne away astern.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae could see no
light.&nbsp; There were no stars in the sky; only a riot of windy
space in which the feeble headlight of the ship made dizzy
plunges, lighting for a moment ragged flakes of snow.&nbsp;
Flying scuds of snow, driven through the darkness, spat upon his
sweating chest.&nbsp; Over there, in the heart of that wild
darkness, Arran lay.&nbsp; The shoulders of Goat Fell stood up
against the storm; Kilmory Water should be in a brown spate;
there, in the Clachan, they would all be sound asleep, all but
the two sheep-dogs lying with their noses to the hearth, where
fiery patterns were stealing through white ashes of peat.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae stood waiting in the cold for the expected
thrill.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t come. . . .&nbsp; He could only
think in that perverse moment of sunshine and light; of the green
mountain slopes above Buenos Ayres and blue, intense shadows on
the pavement of the Plaza where dark-skinned ranchers from inland
<i>estancias</i> lounged at the scattered tables of the
caf&eacute;s.&nbsp; <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>His utmost will was powerless to
enslave his imagination.&nbsp; He shivered, and turned gratefully
to the oily heat of the engine-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did ye see it?&rdquo; the engineer shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s a fine sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I saw it,&rdquo; M&lsquo;Crae lied, and his reply
was accepted for the proper Scots enthusiasm.&nbsp; He was not
sorry when the ship sailed south again.&nbsp; All the time that
she stayed in the port of Glasgow was marred by snow and sleet
and rain.</p>
<p>For all that, in later years he had thought of returning more
than once.&nbsp; One day, at Simonstown, he had watched a
Highland regiment sailing for home at the end of the Boer
War.&nbsp; Someone had started to sing <i>The Flowers of the
Forest</i> in a high tenor voice.&nbsp; Tears had come into his
eyes, and, having a heap of gold sewn in his waistcoat, he had
almost decided to book his passage on a mail-boat, until,
loitering down Adderley Street on his way to the shipping
offices, he had fallen in with a man who had found copper in
Katanga, near the shores of Tanganyika, and in half-an-hour they
had decided to set out together by the next northward
train.&nbsp; And it had always been like that.&nbsp; Some chance
had invariably stood between him and his old home.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I shall never see it again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Eva softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the things of which I feel
certain.&nbsp; I shall never leave Africa now.&nbsp; Even in
Africa I&rsquo;ve come across things <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>that made me think of Arran.&nbsp; I
remember. . . .&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a place up above the Rift
Valley, eight thousand feet of altitude.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called
Kijabe.&nbsp; One of these Germans built a hotel there.&nbsp;
<i>N&rsquo;gijabi</i> had the meaning of wind in Masai.&nbsp; And
it can blow there.&nbsp; Long before the German came near the
place I was there . . . before the railway ran to Naivasha.&nbsp;
I camped there for a week, and all the week I never so much as
saw the valley or the lake.&nbsp; Nothing but thin white mist,
mist as white as milk, just like the stuff that comes dripping
off Goat Fell.&nbsp; I remembered. . . .&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a
long digression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed softly.&nbsp; And then he told her of many voyages
at sea in which he had come upon strange things that are no
longer to be seen.&nbsp; Once in a sailing ship he had doubled
the icy Horn; and later, sailing out of &lsquo;Frisco, had been
wrecked on Kiu-Siu, the southern island of Japan, being cast up
on a beach of yellow sand where the slow Pacific swell was
spilling in creamy ripples.&nbsp; A woman found him there, an
ugly, flat-faced woman, who carried a baby on her back.&nbsp; It
was a little bay with a pointed volcanic hill at either horn all
covered in climbing pine-trees.&nbsp; At the back of it stood the
reed huts of fishermen and on the level plats of sand brown nets
were spread to dry.&nbsp; &ldquo;A beautiful and simple
people,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In these days, they tell me,
they have been spoiled.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a month he lived there,
lived upon dried fish and rice, wandering over the red paths
which climbed between the pines on those pointed hillocks.&nbsp;
It was February, and peerless weather.&nbsp; By the wayside
violets <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>were hiding, and in the air flapped the lazy wings of
the meadow browns that he had known in Arran.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
seen those butterflies in Africa too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s strange
how a thing like that will piece together one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
I could tell you things of that kind for ever, if it
weren&rsquo;t that they would tire you.&nbsp; And they
don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I killed a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and she felt that his eyes were on her more than
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I lost my name.&nbsp; The one that I
found again the other night.&nbsp; At the time it seemed to me a
terrible thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so sure that I think it
terrible now.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t killed him he would have
killed me; but for all that the quarrel was of my making.&nbsp;
It was in Singapore . . . in Malay Street, Singapore.&nbsp; A
street with a bad name.&nbsp; He was a Russian sailor, and he was
treating a woman in the way that no woman, whatever her trade
might be, should be treated.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know the
woman.&nbsp; I shot him.&nbsp; In a second the place was swarming
like an ant&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; I had my clothes torn from me,
but I got away.&nbsp; I was three weeks hiding in an opium shop
in Singapore.&nbsp; The Chinese will do anything for you for
money.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to be hanged, for in those days
I put a higher value on life than I do now . . . a funny thing to
say of a man who had just killed another.&nbsp; I hid among the
long bunks where Chinese sailors were lying.&nbsp; The place was
dark, with a low roof, and full of the heavy smoke of
opium.&nbsp; I was used to that; for one of our quartermasters
was an <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>opium smoker and the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle of the
<i>Mary Deans</i> always smelt of it.&nbsp; I spent three weeks
thinking of my past sins and watching a pattern of golden dragons
on the roof; and I did more thinking there than I had ever done
in my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of those three weeks Ah Qui&mdash;that was
the Chinaman&rsquo;s name&mdash;got me away.&nbsp; I remember the
night.&nbsp; We pulled out in a <i>sampan</i> from Tanjong Pagar
under the lee of a little island.&nbsp; Pulo . . . Pulo something
or other.&nbsp; There was an oily sea lapping round the piles on
which the Malays had built their huts and one of those heavy
skies that you get in the Straits washed all over with summer
lightning.&nbsp; But the taste of clean air after three weeks of
opium fumes!&nbsp; They got me on to a junk that was sailing for
Batavia, in Java.&nbsp; Old Ah Qui had stripped me of every
dollar I possessed.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t do it for a cent
less.&nbsp; When I found myself on the deck of that junk,
breathing free air under the flapping sails, the want of money
didn&rsquo;t trouble me.&nbsp; I stretched out my arms.&nbsp; I
filled my lungs.&nbsp; I could have sung for joy . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Batavia I shipped under the Dutch flag under the
name of Charles Hare.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a bad name.&nbsp; It
came to me in a flash.&nbsp; We landed at Capetown in the year
eighteen eighty-five.&nbsp; It was the year after the discovery
of gold at De Kaap; Moodie&rsquo;s farm had just been
opened.&nbsp; Everybody was talking of gold.&nbsp; While we lay
in Table Bay waiting for cargo they found the Sheba reef.&nbsp;
We heard of it, myself and another man named Miles, in a dope
shop down by <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>the harbour.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t think twice about
it.&nbsp; That very night we set off for the Transvaal on
foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was one of the lucky ones.&nbsp; We had a fair start
of the others who came flocking out from Europe.&nbsp; And it
wasn&rsquo;t only luck.&nbsp; I kept my head.&nbsp; That is part
of the virtue of being a Scotsman.&nbsp; I kept my head where
poor Miles didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I had had my lesson: those three
weeks of hard thinking in Ah Qui&rsquo;s opium shop.&nbsp; And
Miles went under.&nbsp; Twice I put him on his feet again, but he
didn&rsquo;t pay for helping.&nbsp; He was never the man that I
should have chosen.&nbsp; He just happened to be the only white
man aboard that Dutch ship.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t make a new man
of him.&nbsp; I suppose he was a born waster.&nbsp; There were
plenty like that on the Rand in eighty-six.&nbsp; I saw scores of
them go under.&nbsp; And as for murder . . . that was common
enough to make me wonder what all the fuss had been about in
Singapore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was lucky, as I told you.&nbsp; I left the Rand in
eighty-seven.&nbsp; During the last year, when I had parted with
Miles and was working for myself, I had experienced a big
reaction.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the adventurous way in which
I had been living wasn&rsquo;t worth while.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d seen
the example of Miles . . . poor fellow . . . and remembered
Singapore.&nbsp; Besides, I had a good bit of money banked with
the Jews&mdash;enough to live on for the rest of my
life&mdash;and the mere fact of possessing money makes you look
at the world in a different way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bad thing for
a young man . . . I&rsquo;m sure of that.&nbsp; But I was a lot
older than my years.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;At any rate, when I left the place where
Jo&rsquo;burg is now I swore that I&rsquo;d keep what I&rsquo;d
got.&nbsp; I came down to the Cape again, and built a little
house out Muizenburg way . . . up above the winter pool they call
Zand Vlei . . . a fine little wooden house; and I planted peaches
there, and a plumbago hedge round my mealies.&nbsp; It was all my
idea of a home.&nbsp; And then, just as the house was beginning
to be all that I expected it, I came across a woman.&nbsp; I had
never known what it was to be in love before.&nbsp; I was a
simple enough lad, for all my money and my pretty house.&nbsp;
She was an assistant in one of the stores that stood where
Adderley Street is now.&nbsp; An English-woman.&nbsp; She had
come out there as &lsquo;mother&rsquo;s help,&rsquo; or whatever
they call it, to some Government people; and when they were
recalled Mr. Jenkins had asked her if she would come into his
store.&nbsp; I fancy they came from the same part of the
country.&nbsp; Her home was in Herefordshire.&nbsp; She stayed at
Jenkins&rsquo;, and it was there I found her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful woman . . . beautiful, I mean in every
way.&nbsp; But it was for so little, so very little . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell <i>you</i> . . . I feel I can tell you
because&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll allow me to be personal&mdash;she
had much the same colouring as you; the same eyes, the same
straight eyebrows, the same sort of hair.&nbsp; I almost fancy
her speech was like yours too.&nbsp; But one forgets.&nbsp; It
was thirty years ago . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say much about it.&nbsp; The whole of
that experience was like an evening in spring.&nbsp; As short <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>and as
beautiful.&nbsp; And we felt . . . we felt that this was only the
beginning.&nbsp; One feels that on an early spring evening there
is so much in reserve; first the season when the may comes; and
then full summer&mdash;long summer evenings with bees in the
heather; and, afterwards, autumn with the rowan berries.&nbsp; It
was like that.&nbsp; We were waiting on an evening of that kind
with just the confidence that young people have in all the
beautiful things which will happen in the ordinary passage of
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was all.&nbsp; She died.&nbsp; Cruelly . . .
cruelly.&nbsp; Without any warning.&nbsp; She was only ill three
days.&nbsp; That is the kind of thing that makes a man despise
life.&nbsp; I had lost everything . . . everything . . . utterly
lost everything . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused.&nbsp; Eva had drawn back her chair a little from
the light.&nbsp; She was crying.&nbsp; It was impossible for her
to speak.&nbsp; She wondered if she should have spoken.&nbsp; Out
of the darkness they heard a deep and throaty rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>After that there followed a silence.</p>
<p>At last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then my life began . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blow of that kind knocks a man silly for a
time.&nbsp; When he opens his eyes after it nothing looks the
same.&nbsp; I was restless.&nbsp; I wanted to find something new
to fill the gap in my mind.&nbsp; I hated that little house at
Muizenberg in which I had promised myself to end my days.&nbsp;
The only thing that did me any good was walking, the lonelier the
better.&nbsp; I used to walk <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>over the neck of the peninsula and
climb Table Mountain, up above the Twelve Apostles.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d walk there for hours in the white mist that lies on the
top&mdash;they call it the tablecloth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve slept
there more than once when the fog has caught me.&nbsp; And though
I&rsquo;ve never been back there since those days I was just sane
enough to remember that it&rsquo;s a wonderful place for
flowers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many very pretty things there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening when I came down from the mountain I saw a
youngish man looking at my plumbago hedge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty
place you&rsquo;ve got here,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kind of
place that would just suit me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you
want it for?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; He blushed . . . he was a nice
young fellow. . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;Getting married,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; That nearly did me.&nbsp; I could have burst out crying
on the spot.&nbsp; But I got him in for a sundowner all the
same.&nbsp; He started telling me all about the young lady.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
rather not hear.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think that I want to offend
you.&nbsp; But if you want the house you can have it.&nbsp; You
can have it for two-thirds what it cost me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d almost have given it him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a week we had the thing settled.&nbsp; That year
they found gold in the Zoutspanberg district.&nbsp; It was new
country, very mountainous and wild.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mind
where I went as long as I could forget the other thing.&nbsp; I
went there by easy stages, seeing a goodish bit of country.&nbsp;
I sunk my money there . . . there and in Zululand.&nbsp; And I
lost it&mdash;every penny of it but the little bit which was
coming in to me, with a scrap of interest, for the Muizenburg
farm.&nbsp; I lost my money . . . but I think I found myself.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;It was a great game country, that.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s much game left there now, but
in those days it was swarming, all the way from the mountains to
the Limpopo.&nbsp; It was a big, lonely country.&nbsp; Those were
the two things that got hold of me.&nbsp; I used to ride out
there on hunting expeditions with no more company than one
boy.&nbsp; I remember sitting there one night after supper with a
pipe of Boer tobacco, and then the thought came to me:
&lsquo;Good God! as I sit here now there&rsquo;s probably not
another white man within fifty miles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the beginning of it.&nbsp; I began to follow
out the idea, and I soon realised that my fifty miles was nothing
to speak of.&nbsp; North of me it would easily run into thousands
. . . thousands of miles of country that no living man knew
anything about; where, for all we knew, there might be rivers and
lakes and cities even that had never been seen, all waiting for a
man who would set out to find them for the love of the
thing.&nbsp; It was a big idea, almost too big for one
man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; But it was the very thing for which my
loneliness had been waiting.&nbsp; Africa. . . .&nbsp; Years
afterwards&mdash;I think it was after the war&mdash;I came across
a poem by Kipling: a man, one of your amateur settlers, showed it
me in the Kenya province.&nbsp; It was about Africa.&nbsp; He
called Africa &lsquo;the woman wonderful.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes . . .
&lsquo;lived a woman wonderful,&rsquo; it began.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
lost one wonderful woman.&nbsp; Now I found another.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve lived with her for thirty years and I have never come
anywhere near the end of her wonder, though I know more of her
than <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>most men.&nbsp; Why, there <i>is</i> no end.&nbsp;
There is always something new.&nbsp; Even in the last week I have
stumbled on something new and wonderful.&nbsp; Tonight . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had three years of it south of the Limpopo.&nbsp; In
eighteen ninety I heard that Rhodes was sending an expedition
into Mashonaland.&nbsp; There were only five hundred of us in
&lsquo;ninety; but I always want to shake a man by the hand if he
was with us in those days.&nbsp; The men who rode up to Salisbury
. . . men that I&rsquo;d still give my life for: men like
Selous.&nbsp; A great hunter, and a good man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that day to this my life has been much the
same.&nbsp; There have been one or two diversions.&nbsp; In
ninety-five the Jameson raid, and a few years later the Boer
War.&nbsp; Wasted years . . . but I didn&rsquo;t fully realise
the value of time in those days.&nbsp; I was a wild fellow
too.&nbsp; God knows how much I drank.&nbsp; A young man thinks
that he is going to live for ever.&nbsp; Still, I suppose there
was a mess to be cleared up and it had to be done, and after the
war I had my own way.&nbsp; I never slept where I couldn&rsquo;t
see the Southern Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell you a good deal about Africa, all Africa
from the Orange River to Lake Chad and the Blue Nile, and the
Lorian Swamp.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve hunted everywhere&mdash;not for
the love of hunting, but because a man must live.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve not been one of those that make hunting pay.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve shot elephants because ivory would keep me in food and
porters and ammunition.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve poached ivory with a
clear conscience for the same reason.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found
gold, gold and copper: and <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>I&rsquo;ve let other men scramble
for the fortunes.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want their fortunes.&nbsp;
I wanted to know Africa.&nbsp; And always . . . for my own sake,
not for the sake of other people, I have made notes of the things
that I saw, of kindly peoples, of good water, and things like
that.&nbsp; Some day I might make a book about them; but it would
be a big book, and I haven&rsquo;t any skill in writing.&nbsp; If
I could write of all the beauty and strangeness that I&rsquo;ve
seen as I saw them a man would never put down the book that I
wrote.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the meaning of the notebooks that I
carried in my shirt pockets.&nbsp; There are a lot more stored
with the Standard Bank.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;ve been at it for
thirty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s not so easy as it used to be.&nbsp; The
zest is there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as eager, you might almost say, as
a child; but the power isn&rsquo;t the same.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
starve in the same way as I used to.&nbsp; In the old days I
could live on a little biltong and coffee and the mealie flour I
got from the natives.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m handicapped in other
ways.&nbsp; Five years ago I lost my left arm.&nbsp; I was lucky
not to lose my life, for a wounded elephant charged and got
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t kill me, for in spite of
it all I&rsquo;ve had a good time since.&nbsp; I can shoot
straight, thank God, if I have something on which to rest my
rifle.&nbsp; German East has always been an unlucky country for
me.&nbsp; It was near Meru that the elephant got me.&nbsp; One of
the Dutchmen in the Arusha settlement had a down on me, and
there&rsquo;s been a warrant out for my arrest.&nbsp; The other
day, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, they would have had
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good thing they didn&rsquo;t; for I want
to see this <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>country.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard funny things about the
Waluguru.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re worth more to me than ivory.&nbsp;
When this shoulder&rsquo;s better perhaps I shall find out if the
things I&rsquo;ve heard are true . . . and I&rsquo;ve never been
to Kissaki or the Rufiji Delta . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s strange how
little a man can really tell of his life.&nbsp; The things that
matter, the wonderful moments, can&rsquo;t be told at all.&nbsp;
What I&rsquo;ve been able to tell you sounds like . . . like
nothing more than what might have happened to any hard case
who&rsquo;s knocked about Africa for thirty years.&nbsp; But for
all that life has been precious to me.&nbsp; Perhaps you will
think it the kind of life that wasn&rsquo;t worth saving.&nbsp;
You mustn&rsquo;t think that.&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m
grateful.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m grateful even for these last
hours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m grateful that you&rsquo;ve allowed me to
make this sort of confession.&nbsp; It worried me that I should
have started off with a lie to a woman like you.&nbsp; It
hadn&rsquo;t struck me that way ever before.&nbsp; I dare say it
was foolish of me; but when one is weak one gets those twinges of
. . . of conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that you&rsquo;ll forgive me . .

138</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>I suppose that their talk that night made a good deal of
difference to the intimacy of their relation.&nbsp; No doubt it
cost M&lsquo;Crae a considerable effort to speak of things which
had been locked in his heart for years.&nbsp; As he himself said,
&ldquo;he was no great hand at talking.&rdquo;&nbsp; With Eva it
was different.&nbsp; The small things of which her life had been
composed came to him easily, in the ordinary way of
talking.&nbsp; Among them there were no passages of which it was
difficult to speak; nothing in the very least exciting had ever
happened to her before she had set foot in Africa, so few months
before.</p>
<p>Since then, indeed, there was a great deal that was both
difficult and puzzling.&nbsp; It was so great a relief to her to
be able to speak of them that she told him everything, freely,
withholding nothing.&nbsp; She told him how, at first, she had
mistrusted the man Bullace: of the equivocal way in which he had
spoken of Godovius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullace?&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae, thinking,
&ldquo;Bullace. . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help
you.&nbsp; Although I know the name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s possible,
even probable, that he drank; though I must tell you that he is
the first missionary I&rsquo;ve ever heard of who did.&nbsp;
People at home talk <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>more nonsense, I should imagine,
about missionaries than about any other body of men.&nbsp; On the
one side of their sacrifices.&nbsp; They do make
sacrifices.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; But you must remember that
a man who has once lived in the wilds of Africa doesn&rsquo;t
take kindly to life at home.&nbsp; They have their wives.&nbsp;
They have children.&nbsp; That, I think, is a mistake.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s the other side; the people who laugh at all
missionary work and talk about the folly of ramming Christianity
down the throats of people who have good working religions of
their own.&nbsp; They are just as wide of the mark as the
others.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known a good many missionaries; and for
the most part I believe they&rsquo;re neither worse nor better
than their fellows.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re just men.&nbsp; And men
are mostly good . . . even the worst of them.&nbsp; If this poor
fellow Bullace drank there&rsquo;s a good deal to be said for
him.&nbsp; Most Europeans who live in the tropics, particularly
if they live alone in a place like Luguru, do drink.&nbsp; At one
time&mdash;about the time of the Boer War&mdash;I drank about as
much as any man could do and live.&nbsp;
Loneliness&mdash;loneliness will drive a man to drink, if he
hasn&rsquo;t some strong interest to keep him going.&nbsp; I had
Africa.&nbsp; Probably Bullace had nothing.&nbsp; I told you that
I&rsquo;ve heard strange things about the Waluguru.&nbsp; I
daresay Bullace found that he was a failure . . . a hopeless
failure, without any chance of getting away from the scene of his
failure.&nbsp; And so he drank to kill time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
altogether blame him . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked to her also a good deal about James, and <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>the
particular side of the missionary problem which he had the
misfortune to illustrate.&nbsp; It was a great relief to Eva that
they were able to do this.&nbsp; In those earlier days when
Godovius had appeared to her in the r&ocirc;le of a helper and
adviser, they had often spoken of James and his troubles; but in
this matter Godovius had been obviously unsympathetic: he
hadn&rsquo;t thought that James was worth Eva&rsquo;s troubling
about, and had therefore decided that the topic should be
discreetly and swiftly shelved.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae was very
different.&nbsp; He listened to Eva&rsquo;s troubles without a
hint of impatience, realising just how important they were to
her.&nbsp; It flattered her to find herself taken seriously in
little frailties of which she herself was not sure that she
oughtn&rsquo;t to be ashamed.</p>
<p>One evening, when confidences seemed to come most easily, she
told him the whole story of her relations with Godovius: the
first impressions of distrust which his kindness had removed, his
bewildering outbursts of passion and at last the whole story of
her visit to the House of the Moon.&nbsp; She told him, half
smiling, of the frightening atmosphere of her journey, of
Godovius&rsquo;s amazing room, of the shock which his photograph
had given her.&nbsp; It astonished her to find how easy it was to
confide in this man.</p>
<p>He listened attentively, and at last pressed her to tell him
again of the terraces on the side of the hill; and the abandoned
building of stone from which the doves had fluttered out.</p>
<p>She told him all that she remembered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why do
you want to know?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;It is very curious,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;very curious.&nbsp; When we rode up into Rhodesia in 1890
we came across the same sort of thing.&nbsp; But on a bigger
scale.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll not have heard of it,
but there are great ruins there that they call the Zimbabwes,
about which the learned people have been quarrelling ever
since.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re near the site of the Phoenician gold
workings&mdash;King Solomon&rsquo;s Mines&mdash;and they&rsquo;re
supposed to be connected with the worship of the Syrian goddess,
Astarte, of whom your brother could tell you more than I
can.&nbsp; But I take it she was a moon goddess by her
symbols.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s curious because of the way in which
it fits in here.&nbsp; Kilima ja Mweze. . . .&nbsp; The mountain
of the moon.&nbsp; Godovius&rsquo;s home, too.&nbsp; And the
strange thing is that it tallies with the stories which I heard
from the Masai about the Waluguru; the stories that brought me
over into this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the night of the new moon when I went
there,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Onyango was afraid to go
to the Waluguru for the same reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Yes . . . it&rsquo;s a matter that needs
thinking over.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, after a long pause:
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m thankful that I came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my sake,&rdquo; she said softly.&nbsp; He only
smiled.</p>
<p>After that they did not speak of Godovius for a long
time.&nbsp; I think those evenings must have been very wonderful
for both of them; for it is doubtful if either M&lsquo;Crae or
Eva had ever shared an intimacy of this kind.&nbsp; In it there
was no hint of love-making.&nbsp; The extraordinary candour of
their relation made <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>impossible the bashfulness and
misunderstanding out of which love-making so often springs.&nbsp;
The difference of age between them made it unlikely that Eva
should think of M&lsquo;Crae as a lover; and he was not a young
man in whom the mere physical presence of a woman would awaken
passion.&nbsp; Many years ago he had outgrown that sort of thing;
so that the result of their intimacy was a wholly delightful
relation, which resembled, in its frankness and freedom from the
subconscious posings of sex, the friendship of two men or of a
man and a woman happily married who have rid themselves of the
first restlessness of passion.&nbsp; To Eva it seemed that this
state of innocence might last for ever.&nbsp; To M&lsquo;Crae,
who knew the workings of the human heart more widely, it seemed
very beautiful, and very like her, that she should think so.</p>
<p>But if Eva realised no threat to their peace of mind in the
shape of passion, she was certainly conscious of other dangers to
their secret happiness.&nbsp; She knew that the day must come
when the presence of M&lsquo;Crae would be revealed to James, who
seemed, for the time, to have got the better of the fever in his
blood.&nbsp; She dreaded this because she knew that when it came
to that she must almost certainly lose M&lsquo;Crae; and the
presence of M&lsquo;Crae had made her happier than she had ever
been before at Luguru.&nbsp; James wouldn&rsquo;t understand
their position.&nbsp; She could be sure of that in advance.&nbsp;
To say that James wasn&rsquo;t capable of relieving her of the
attentions of Godovius would not help matters much, for James had
a good opinion of himself in the r&ocirc;le of the protecting
male.&nbsp; <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>The idea that his place should be taken by a one-armed
elephant-hunter of the most doubtful antecedents, who had stolen
into his house in the night while he lay sick with fever, would
not appeal to him.&nbsp; Indeed, there was bound to be trouble
with James.</p>
<p>I do not suppose that the question of what James&rsquo;
attitude would be gave much worry to M&lsquo;Crae; but there was
another threat to their peace of mind, of which they both were
conscious and which could not be regarded so lightly.&nbsp;
Godovius. . . .&nbsp; All the time Eva was conscious of him in
the back of her mind, and particularly at night when she and
M&lsquo;Crae sat in the <i>banda</i> talking.&nbsp; Then, from
time to time, she would find herself overwhelmed with very much
the same sort of feeling as that which she had experienced on the
way down from Njumba ja Mweze, just before she had met
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; Now, as ever, the nights were full of
restless sound; and every sound that invaded their privacy began
to be associated with the idea of Godovius; so that when a branch
rustled or a twig snapped at night she would never have been
surprised to have seen Godovius standing over them.&nbsp; He had
always had the way of appearing suddenly.&nbsp; She grew very
nervous and jerky and, in the end, possessed by the idea that all
their careful concealment was an elaborate waste of time; that
Godovius knew perfectly well all that had happened from that
night to this; that her precious secret wasn&rsquo;t really a
secret at all.</p>
<p>It would almost have been a relief to her if he had appeared,
not only to save her from the anxiety of M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s
concealment, but because no material <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>manifestation of his presence or his
power could be half so wearing as the imponderable threat of his
absence.&nbsp; For she knew that it had got to come.&nbsp; The
story of his strange passion could not conceivably be ended by
her flight from Njumba ja Mweze.&nbsp; She knew that he would not
have let her go so lightly if he had not been confident that she
couldn&rsquo;t really escape from the sphere of his
influence.&nbsp; It was as though he had said: &ldquo;Flutter
away, tire yourself out with flutterings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite
prepared to wait for you.&nbsp; The end will be the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; She could almost have wished that he had
followed her in more passionate pursuit instead of nursing this
leisurely appetite of a fat man who sits down in a restaurant
waiting complacently for a meal which he has ordered with
care.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>In this way the weeks passed by.&nbsp; At last James was so
far recovered that he was able to sit out on a long basket-chair
upon the stoep, surveying the field of his labours.&nbsp; Every
evening he would sit there until the sun set and the frogs began
their chorus.&nbsp; His last experience of fever had made him a
little fussy about himself; not so much for his own sake as
because he knew that a few more attacks of this kind would make
life impossible for him in that country.&nbsp; He might even be
forced to leave it, a failure; and this humiliating prospect made
him unusually careful.&nbsp; When he had sat on the stoep for a
few evenings he began to try his legs.&nbsp; He walked, <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>leaning
upon Eva&rsquo;s arm, the length of the garden beneath the avenue
of the acacias.&nbsp; In those days he seemed to Eva increasingly
human.&nbsp; Indeed, this was the nearest she ever came to loving
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
miracles you had been performing in this garden.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been too absorbed in my work&mdash;selfishly, perhaps&mdash;to
notice them before.&rdquo;&nbsp; He showed a childish interest in
fruits and flowers which he had never taken the trouble to
observe before.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you have been ill
indoors,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everything that grows seems
somehow . . . I can&rsquo;t get the right word&mdash;the fever
has done that for me . . . somehow fresh.&nbsp; Almost
hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were standing together at the far end of the garden, so
near to the <i>banda</i> that Eva knew that M&lsquo;Crae must
hear everything that was said.&nbsp; Indeed, M&lsquo;Crae was
listening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know, Eva,&rdquo; he heard James
say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been inside your summer-house.&nbsp;
It must be cool&mdash;beautifully cool on these hot
afternoons.&nbsp; Better than the house.&nbsp; Do you remember
the summer-house at the bottom of the garden at Far Forest?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d never let anyone use that.&rdquo;&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae
heard Eva laugh softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this one&rsquo;s the
same,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be jealous,
for you&rsquo;ve got our best room for your study.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her voice trembled a little at the end of the sentence.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae realised that she was frightened for him.&nbsp; It
disturbed him to think that a creature so beautifully innocent as
Eva should be forced into dissimulation for his sake.&nbsp; The
experience of the last few weeks seemed to have made him
surprisingly sensitive on matters of honour; a <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>curious
phenomenon at his time of life.&nbsp; He tackled Eva the same
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James would have come into the <i>banda</i>,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never know what might happen.&nbsp;
Probably he would have wanted to look through into your part of
it.&nbsp; And then . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have stopped him somehow; I should have told
him some story or other.&rdquo;&nbsp; She became acutely
conscious of his eyes on her face and blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I should have told a lie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if that is what
you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things will get more and more
difficult,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For you, I mean.&nbsp;
Now that I can look after myself, I don&rsquo;t think I ought to
stay in your <i>banda</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a long time for her reply.&nbsp; She sat there with
downcast eyes; and when, at last, she raised them, even though
she was smiling, they were full of tears.&nbsp; It was a very
sweet and dangerous moment.&nbsp; She heard the voice of James
calling her from the stoep, and was glad of the excuse to leave
him.</p>
<p>These were trying days for all of them.&nbsp; James
didn&rsquo;t pick up very quickly.&nbsp; The weather had begun to
show a variation from a type that is not altogether uncommon in
the neighbourhood of isolated mountain patches such as the Luguru
Hills.&nbsp; The time about dawn was as fresh and lovely as ever,
but as the day wore on the heavy mood with which noon burdened
the countryside increased.&nbsp; Upon the wide horizon companies
of cloud massed and assembled, <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>enormous clouds, as black and
ponderable as the mountains themselves.&nbsp; By the hour of
sunset they would threaten the whole sky and ring it round as
though they were laying particular siege to the Mission Station
itself and must shortly overwhelm it in thunder and violent
rain.&nbsp; Beneath this menace the sunsets were unusually savage
and fantastic, lighting such lurid skies as are to be found in
medi&aelig;val pictures of great battle-fields or of hell
itself.&nbsp; These days were all amazingly quiet: as though the
wild things in the bush were conscious of the threatening sky,
and only waited for it to be broken with thunder or ripped with
lightning flashes.&nbsp; With the descent of darkness this sense
of anticipation grew heavier still.&nbsp; It was difficult to
sleep for the heat and for the feeling of intolerable
pressure.&nbsp; But when morning came not one shred of cloud
would mar the sky.</p>
<p>As I have said, it was trying weather for all of them.&nbsp;
For James, who read in the sunset apocalyptic terrors; for
M&lsquo;Crae, sweating in the confined space of Bullace&rsquo;s
<i>banda</i>; for Eva, who found in the skies a reinforcement of
that sense of dread and apprehension with which the menace of
Godovius oppressed her.&nbsp; Still it would not rain and still
Godovius did not come . . .</p>
<p>One evening M&lsquo;Crae said to her suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hear your Waluguru boys working near the
<i>banda</i> now.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ll have kept them at
the other end of the garden for my sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him that she was always frightened when anyone came
near him.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the worst, nothing very serious could
happen.&nbsp; But I want you to keep them working near me.&nbsp;
I think this sisal hedge at the back of the <i>banda</i> is badly
in need of thinning.&nbsp; You can put them to weed it if you
like.&nbsp; Any job that you like to give them, as long as they
are working near me.&nbsp; I want to listen to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will find out that you are here,&rdquo; she said
in a voice that was rather pitiable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect they know it already, but they probably
don&rsquo;t know that I can understand what they say when they
are talking together.&nbsp; I am curious, as I told you, about
the Waluguru.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m curious about Godovius
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day she put the boys to work upon a patch of sweet
potatoes under the sisal hedge.&nbsp; In the evening when she
came to M&lsquo;Crae she could see that he had heard
something.&nbsp; For all his hard experience of life he was a
very simple soul.&nbsp; Once or twice when she spoke to him he
had to wait a second to remember the echo of her question, and
she quickly saw that his mind would really rather have been
thinking of something else.&nbsp; This was the only sign of his
preoccupation.&nbsp; In every other way he was his solemn self,
taking everything that she said with a seriousness which was
sometimes embarrassing.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want always to be
taken in such deadly earnest, and now it seemed to her almost as
if he were taking advantage of this peculiarity to evade
her.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t going to have that.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;You might just as well tell me first as
last,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>At this he was honestly surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how do you
know I have anything to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so easy to understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He smiled and looked at her, wondering.&nbsp; It had never
exactly struck him that a woman could understand him so
completely.&nbsp; Of course he knew nothing about women, but for
all that he had always been completely satisfied that there
wasn&rsquo;t much to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to tell you things that I&rsquo;m not even
sure of myself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason . . . for I might help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No. . . .&nbsp; I have to
think it out myself, to piece a lot of things together: what I
heard from the Masai: what I hear from you, the things I&rsquo;ve
heard the Waluguru talking about to-day.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell
you until I&rsquo;m satisfied myself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m simply curious . .
.&rdquo; and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t think
that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so straight.&nbsp; You need never think
that for one moment.&nbsp; Even if it were difficult I should be
perfectly straight with you.&nbsp; We began that way.&nbsp; We
mustn&rsquo;t ever be anything else.&nbsp; Or else . . . or else
there&rsquo;d be an end of . . . of what makes our friendship
unlike any other that I have known.&nbsp; I shall never hide
anything from you.&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; Is that quite
clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Yes, I understand.&nbsp; I feel like that too
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;Oh, but you . . .&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And he
couldn&rsquo;t say any more.&nbsp; It was not seldom that he
found himself at a loss for words in his dealings with Eva.</p>
<p>For two or three days M&lsquo;Crae lay close to the grass wall
of his <i>banda</i>, listening to the talk of the boys.&nbsp; For
the most part it was a thankless and a straining task; for they
talked nearly always of things which had no part in his problem:
of their own life under the leaves, of James, whom they had
christened <i>N&rsquo;gombe</i>, or Ox, for the obvious reason
that he was a vegetarian.&nbsp; Only here and there could he pick
out a sentence that referred to Sakharani&mdash;it was certain
that the Waluguru were afraid to speak of him&mdash;but in the
end he learned enough to confirm the story of the Masai: that the
Waluguru were a people among whom an old religion, connected in
some way with the procreative powers of nature and the symbol of
the waxing moon, survived; that this faith and its rites were
associated by tradition with the hill named Kilima ja Mweze, on
which the house of Godovius was built, and that a white man, now
identified with Sakharani, was in some way connected with its
ritual.&nbsp; How this might be, M&lsquo;Crae could not imagine;
for the thing seemed to him contrary to all nature.&nbsp; There
was no reason for it that he could see, and the mind of
M&lsquo;Crae worked within strictly logical boundaries.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t any conception of the kind of brain which filled
Godovius&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; He simply knew that to the Waluguru
he was the power they feared most on earth, as a savage people
fears its gods.&nbsp; He was <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>anxious to know more; this was
exactly the sort of adventure for which he had lived for thirty
years.</p>
<p>One other thing troubled him.&nbsp; He was certain that at
some time or other he had heard a story about Godovius which now
he couldn&rsquo;t remember; he could not even remember when or
where he had heard it.&nbsp; But one morning, when the light
which penetrated the grass walls of his <i>banda</i> wakened him,
it suddenly returned to him; suddenly and so clearly that he
wondered how he could ever have forgotten it.&nbsp; It concerned
a woman: in all probability the woman in the photograph which Eva
had seen.&nbsp; Of her origin he knew nothing, nor even how she
had come to live with Godovius.&nbsp; In those days there had
been another man at Njumba ja Mweze, a planter, expert in coffee,
who had ordered the cultivation of Godovius&rsquo;s terraced
fields.&nbsp; His name was Hirsch.&nbsp; He had rather fancied
himself as an artist in the violent Bavarian way, and it was
probable that the pictures of native women on Godovius&rsquo;s
walls were his work.&nbsp; One day while the Waluguru were
clearing the bush from a new patch of coffee-ground near the
house they had disturbed and killed a big black mamba, one of the
most deadly of African snakes.&nbsp; He had brought it into the
house to show Godovius, who straightway discovered in it the
making of an excellent practical joke.&nbsp; For the woman who
shared their house had always lived in dread of snakes, and the
dead monster coiled in her bed might very well give her a pretty
fright.&nbsp; The joke was carefully arranged, the woman sent to
bed by candlelight and the door of her room <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>locked by
Godovius as soon as she had entered.&nbsp; They had waited
outside to listen to her shrieks of terror and she had shrieked
even louder and longer than they had expected.&nbsp; An
altogether admirable entertainment.&nbsp; At last she stopped her
shrieking.&nbsp; They supposed that she had suddenly appreciated
the humour of the situation.&nbsp; They thought that she would
come out and tell them so; but she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and
Godovius, supposing that she was sulking, unlocked the door and
went in to console her.&nbsp; She was lying on the bed, very
white, beside the dead snake; and there was a living snake there
too, which slid away through the window when Godovius entered the
room.&nbsp; It was the mate of the dead mamba which had followed
the scent of its comrade into the room and attacked the woman as
soon as she appeared.&nbsp; She died the same evening.&nbsp; No
one that has been bitten by a black mamba lives.&nbsp; It was an
unpleasant story and probably would never have been known if
Godovius had not quarrelled with Hirsch a few months later.&nbsp;
Hirsch had told it to a couple of men who had come through on a
shooting trip at Neu Langenburg, in the hotel where he eventually
drank himself to death; for he never returned to Munich, being
barely able to keep himself in liquor with the money which he
earned by painting indecent pictures for the smoking-rooms of
farmers on remote <i>shambas</i>.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae had heard
the yarn in Katanga.&nbsp; A horrible business; but one hears
many strange things, and stranger, between the Congo and German
East.&nbsp; Now, remembering it, he thought of the pathetic
figure in the photograph which had <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>shocked Eva.&nbsp; And this time the
thing seemed more real to him, even if it had little bearing on
the dangers of their present situation.&nbsp; He realised that he
was beginning to be sentimental to a degree on the subject of
women.&nbsp; And when he thought of women in the abstract it was
easy to find a concrete and adorable example in the shape of Eva
herself.&nbsp; He smiled at himself rather seriously, remembering
his age, his vagrant way of life, his tough, battered body, the
disfigurement of his lopped arm.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>On an evening of unparalleled heaviness Godovius came at last
to Luguru.&nbsp; He rode down in the stifling cooler air which
passed for evening, tied his pony to the post of the gate and,
crossing the front of the stoep on which James languished without
notice, made straight for the sand-paved avenue of flamboyant
trees where he knew that Eva would be found.&nbsp; This time
there was no question of her running away from him.&nbsp; He came
upon her midway between the house and M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s
<i>banda</i>, and she would have done anything in the world to
prevent him approaching nearer to this danger-point.&nbsp; She
stood still in the path waiting for him.&nbsp; It was a moment
when the light of the sun was hidden by monstrous tatters of
black cloud, and this suppression of the violence of white light
intensified for a while a great deal of rich colour which might
never have been seen in the glare of day; the tawny sand with
which the avenue was floored, the <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>rich green of the acacia leaves, the
inky hue of those imminent masses of cloud . . . even the warm
swarthiness of Godovius&rsquo;s face: the whole effect being
highly coloured and fantastic as befitted this scene of
melodrama.&nbsp; There is no doubt but that it showed Eva herself
to advantage.&nbsp; Godovius paused to admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light of storms becomes you, Miss Eva,&rdquo; he
said, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nature conspires to show you at
advantage . . . <i>to</i> advantage . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to her strangely unsubtle that he should talk to her
in this way; for she was sure that he knew perfectly well what
she was feeling.&nbsp; Why should they trouble themselves with
such elaborate pretence?&nbsp; She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean: &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come
before?&rsquo;&nbsp; You expected me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expected you.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t want you
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t pretend that you did; but for all that I
think you used me roughly the other night.&nbsp; Your departure
was . . . shall we say . . . lacking in ceremony.&nbsp;
Unreasonably so, I think.&nbsp; For what had I done?&nbsp; What
confidence had I abused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must not ask me to
explain,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t press me
to do so.&nbsp; I wish you hadn&rsquo;t come now.&nbsp; It will
be a good deal better if you will leave us alone.&nbsp; I think
we should go our own ways.&nbsp; It will be better like
that.&nbsp; I wish you would go now . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&ldquo;But that is ridiculous,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In as desolate place like this you can&rsquo;t quarrel
about nothing with your only neighbour.&nbsp; In the middle of a
black population it is necessary that the whites should keep
together.&nbsp; Your brother would understand.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think you realise what it means.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you what it means. . . .&nbsp; And yet I don&rsquo;t think
there is anything to be gained by that.&nbsp; It is you who must
tell me what is the matter with you.&nbsp; Tell me why you were
frightened where there was nothing to fear.&nbsp; What were you
frightened of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would not answer him.&nbsp; He became agitated and spoke
faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were frightened of me.&nbsp; Oh, you were
very clever. . . .&nbsp; But why should you have been
frightened?&nbsp; Because of the name of Sakharani, the
ridiculous name that I told you.&nbsp; Because you thought I was
drunk?&nbsp; I told you, long ago, that there was more than one
way of drunkenness.&nbsp; Ah well, to-night it is a drunken man
that you face.&nbsp; Listen to me, how I stammer.&nbsp; How the
words will not come.&nbsp; You see, I am drunk . . . burning
drunk.&nbsp; You who stand there like a statue, a beautiful
statue of snow, can&rsquo;t the tropics melt you? . . .&nbsp; How
long have I waited for this day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came to her a sudden glow of thankfulness that this had
not happened on that terrible night and in that strange
house.&nbsp; Here, in the homeliness of her own garden, the
situation seemed to have lost some of its terror.</p>
<p>And all the time, in the back of her mind, she was <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>wanting to
keep him away from the <i>banda</i> in which M&lsquo;Crae was
lying.&nbsp; She said: &ldquo;My brother is in the house.&nbsp;
If you want him, I will show you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not let her pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see your brother,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is you that I want.&nbsp; That is why I
came here.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you trust me?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
You are not like your brother. . . .&nbsp; Your brother will be
all right.&nbsp; You are meant for me.&nbsp; That is why you came
here to Luguru; that was what brought you to me the other
night.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t realise your beautiful youth . . .
the use of life.&nbsp; You are like a cold, northern meadow in a
dream of winter.&nbsp; You lie waiting for the sun.&nbsp; And I
am like the sun.&nbsp; It is for you to awaken into spring.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know the beauty of which you are capable.&nbsp;
And you&rsquo;ll never know it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never blossom
in loveliness.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll waste your youth and your
strength on your damned brother, and then you&rsquo;ll marry,
when there is no more hope, some bloodless swine of a clergyman
like him.&nbsp; So to your death.&nbsp; You will have no
life.&nbsp; Death is all they think of.&nbsp; And here is life
waiting for you&mdash;life bursting, overflowing, like the life
of the forest.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t have it.&nbsp; You will fly
in the face of nature, you&rsquo;ll fight forces stronger than
yourself . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>His enthusiasm spent itself.&nbsp; He fell to
tenderness.&nbsp; She was like a flower, he said, a fragile,
temperate flower that he had tried to pluck as if it had been a
great bloom of the forest.&nbsp; It had not been fair to
her.&nbsp; So <i>rein</i>, <i>und sch&ouml;n und hold</i>.&nbsp;
So like Eva.&nbsp; She must forget all his drunkenness.&nbsp; It
was not <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>thus that the spring sun beat upon the northern
fields.&nbsp; More gently, more gently, and he was capable of
gentleness too.&nbsp; No people were more gentle than the
Germans, even as no people could be more magnificently
passionate.&nbsp; &ldquo;We feel more deeply than other
races,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a fault, sometimes, but
a magnificent fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed to think that by this
sudden change of tactics she must inevitably be softened.</p>
<p>She stood with face turned away, conscious of his outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;When you have finished . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah . . . you think you have beaten me,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what if I don&rsquo;t let you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will let me go,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t frighten me as you did Hamisi.&nbsp; And you
can&rsquo;t keep me here.&nbsp; You know you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
It wouldn&rsquo;t be decent or honourable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no honour here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the middle of Africa.&nbsp; No one can
judge between us. . . .&nbsp; That is why you&rsquo;re
mad,&rdquo; he added, with a gesture of impatience, &ldquo;to
waste your beauty, your life.&nbsp; Oh, mad . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would not reply to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is another thing which you don&rsquo;t
remember.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t realise my power.&nbsp; Power is
a good thing.&nbsp; I am fond of it.&nbsp; I possess it.&nbsp; In
this place I am as reverenced as God.&nbsp; In another way I am
as powerful as the Deity; there is nothing that is hidden from
me.&nbsp; Now do you see, now do you see how you stand?&nbsp;
Think. . . .&nbsp; You love your brother?&nbsp; So . . . your
brother is in my hands.&nbsp; <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>This mission is only here because I
allow it.&nbsp; If I will that it succeed, it will succeed.&nbsp;
If I decide that it shall fail, it will fail.&nbsp; I can break
your brother.&nbsp; If you love him it will be better for us to
be friends.&nbsp; And that is not all . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited and she knew what was coming.&nbsp; She felt that
she was going to cry out in spite of herself.&nbsp; She heard
herself swallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know other things.&nbsp; I happen to know exactly how
much your pretence of immaculate virtue is worth.&nbsp; We have
always known that the first characteristic of the English is
hypocrisy.&nbsp; Do you think I don&rsquo;t know all about the
guest in your <i>banda</i>?&nbsp; No doubt the news would
entertain your brother, who is already shocked by the morals of
the Waluguru.&nbsp; A very pretty little romance, which has no
doubt been more amusing to you than it would have been to
him.&nbsp; I believe your missionaries are very particular on the
point of personal example, and it is possible that he would . . .
shall we say? . . . disapprove.&nbsp; Oh, but you need not be
frightened.&nbsp; I shall not tell him, unless it happens to suit
me.&nbsp; As a nation we are very broad-minded.&nbsp; We do not
preach.&nbsp; And I do not condemn you.&nbsp; That is the most
orthodox Christianity.&nbsp; It is natural that a young and
beautiful woman should have a lover.&nbsp; It is natural that she
should have more than one lover.&nbsp; I am gentleman enough not
to grudge you your romance, even if I don&rsquo;t altogether
approve your taste.&nbsp; So, now that your pretence of indignant
virtue is disposed of, there is a <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>possibility that you will be
natural.&nbsp; I am not unreasonable.&nbsp; I merely ask that I
may share these distinguished privileges.&nbsp; Obviously no harm
can be done.&nbsp; I am content to be one of . . . as many as you
wish.&nbsp; Women have found me a lover not wholly
undesirable.&nbsp; I am not old, or unappreciative of your
beauty.&nbsp; Now you will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to say?&nbsp; I have sprung a little
surprise on you?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; I am sufficiently gallant
not to hurry you.&nbsp; You shall think it over.&nbsp; A week
will give you time to think.&nbsp; It is always a shock for a
virtuous woman to realise. . . .&nbsp; But we will leave it at
that.&nbsp; You will see that I am neither jealous nor
ungenerous.&nbsp; You have an opportunity of doing a good turn to
your brother and to the man in whom, to my mind, you are so
unreasonably interested.&nbsp; One may be magnanimous.&nbsp;
<i>You</i> call it &lsquo;playing the game.&rsquo;&nbsp; You
shall think it over, and then we shall come to an
agreement&mdash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t be so foolish as not to do
so&mdash;certain unavoidable things will happen; as unavoidable
as if they were acts of God.&nbsp; I am God here.&nbsp; And you
will have yourself to thank.&nbsp; So, for the present,
we&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;Auf Wiedersehn.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps you
would like to return to your friend in the <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; He
will help you to make up your mind.&nbsp; You can tell him that
this is a bad place for ivory.&nbsp; The elephants played the
devil with my plantations and were all killed years ago.&nbsp;
When he wants to go back he had better apply to me for his <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>porters.&nbsp; As to whether he&rsquo;ll have any
further need for porters . . . well, that&rsquo;s for you to
decide.&nbsp; His fate is in your very beautiful
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he left her.</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> left her standing alone under
the avenue of acacia.&nbsp; A variety of projects swiftly filled
her mind.&nbsp; She must go to M&lsquo;Crae, and tell him
everything.&nbsp; It was strange that M&lsquo;Crae came
first.&nbsp; She must find James without further delay and
explain to him the difficulty in which she was placed.&nbsp; But
it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to explain; the process involved the
whole story of the fugitive, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure that this
was hers to tell.&nbsp; And in any case, James would be sure to
misunderstand.&nbsp; She realised, for the first time, that her
relation with M&lsquo;Crae actually might be misunderstood; and
this filled her, more than ever, with a sort of blind anger which
wouldn&rsquo;t let her see things clearly.&nbsp; It overwhelmed
her with shame to think that M&lsquo;Crae, too, must look at the
matter in the odious light which Godovius had suggested.&nbsp; It
seemed to her that the lovely innocence of their relation had
been smirched for ever.&nbsp; She must have time to think.&nbsp;
Now she couldn&rsquo;t think at all.&nbsp; If she were to creep
quietly into the house and shut herself up in her bedroom she
would be able to cry; and then, perhaps, it would be
easier.&nbsp; Beneath this awful heavy stillness of the charged
sky she could do nothing.&nbsp; It seemed to her in the silence
that all the enormous, unfriendly waste of country was just
waiting quietly <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>to see what she would do.&nbsp; Yes, she had better go
to her room and cry.&nbsp; And then, before she knew what was
happening, a demon of wind swept down from the sky and filled the
branches of the avenue above her with rushing sound.&nbsp; A
scurry of red sand came whirling along the path, and above her
the black sky burst into a torrent of rain; rain so violent that
in a moment her flimsy dress was saturated.&nbsp; Beneath this
radical and alarming remedy for mental anguish she abandoned any
attempt at making up her mind.&nbsp; She simply ran for shelter
to the nearest that offered itself, and this was naturally the
<i>banda</i> of M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>She arrived, breathless, and beautifully flushed.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae was lying at the end of the <i>banda</i> next the
path.&nbsp; She could see that he had been watching them all the
time, even though he could not have heard them.&nbsp; Through the
flimsy wall of grass he had pushed the muzzle of his rifle.</p>
<p>He smiled up at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I had him
covered,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;d better tell
me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, quite against her will, she began to cry, making queer
little noises of which she would have been ashamed if she had
been able to think about them.&nbsp; It had to come . . .</p>
<p>To M&lsquo;Crae the position, in its sudden intimacy, was
infinitely embarrassing.&nbsp; At any time it would have been
painful for him to have seen a woman cry; but Eva was no ordinary
woman in his eyes.&nbsp; She had brought, in a little time, a
tender and very beautiful ideal into his life.&nbsp; He had
thought of her as the <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>incarnation of all the lovely and
desirable things which had passed for ever out of his grasp, and
chiefly of youth, which carries an atmosphere of beauty in
itself.&nbsp; But even more than this, he had worshipped her
naturalness and bravery, so that it was a terrible thing for him
to see her in tears.&nbsp; He knew that no everyday trouble could
have broken her simple and confident courage, and the
consciousness of this adorable weakness overwhelmed him even more
than his admiration of her strength.&nbsp; He saw in a moment
what a child she was, and longed to protect her, as a young man
and a lover might have done.&nbsp; He realised suddenly that the
right to do this had passed from him, years ago . . . years
ago.&nbsp; His eyes filled with tears, and he could do nothing;
for the only things which he might naturally have done were
obviously included in the prerogative of that parental interest
which is the name under which the middle-aged man most often
hides a furtive sensuality.&nbsp; Altogether, the matter was too
harrowing in its complications for an honest man to deal with,
and M&lsquo;Crae, as we have said, found himself in these days a
mass of the most sensitive scruples.&nbsp; For all this he felt
that he couldn&rsquo;t merely sit there with tears in his eyes
and do nothing.&nbsp; It was natural for him to put out his hand
and take hold of her arm.&nbsp; Though she had often enough been
nearer to him than this in her ministrations, he had never
actually touched her before.&nbsp; Through the sodden muslin of
her sleeve his fingers became conscious of her arm&rsquo;s
softness.</p>
<p>He felt the piteous impulse of her sobbing.&nbsp; <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Perhaps it
was because of the coldness of the wet sleeve which he pressed
against her arm that Eva shivered, and M&lsquo;Crae felt that he
had been surprised in an indelicacy.&nbsp; Yet he had only done
the thing which seemed most natural to him.&nbsp; All the time
that she was sobbing, and he so desperately embarrassed by her
tears, the rain was beating on the roof of the <i>banda</i>, so
that if they had spoken they could scarcely have heard each
other; and in a little time its violence penetrated the slanting
reeds of the roof, and water dripped upon them; splashing into
pits of the sandy floor.&nbsp; This rain did not fall as if it
were harried by wind, but with a steady violence, increased from
time to time to an intolerable pitch, as though the sky were
indeed possessed by some brooding intelligence determined to lash
the land without pity.&nbsp; Eva had never heard such rain.&nbsp;
For an hour, maybe, they crouched together without speaking, and
at the end of it, when the wildness of the storm had abated a
little, she had managed to pull together her broken thoughts and
make some decision as to what she would do.</p>
<p>In the beginning she had imagined that she must tell
M&lsquo;Crae everything, but when the first moment at which this
might have happened had passed, and her fit of crying had
overtaken her, she began to count the consequences.&nbsp; She
knew that he would not stay at Luguru for a moment if his
presence endangered her peace.&nbsp; She knew that he would do
anything in the world to save her; and it suddenly struck her
that this involved an obligation on her side.&nbsp; She must not
throw him into Godovius&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Even if she had <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>not
realised this duty, there was always in the back of her mind the
conviction that M&lsquo;Crae was, in fact, the only man on whom
she could rely.&nbsp; She had felt the pressure of his fingers on
her arm, and even though she had shivered she had been touched by
this rather pathetic attempt at sympathy.&nbsp; In that moment he
became no longer a man to be relied on, but one to be
protected.&nbsp; In an ardent vision she saw herself saving the
two of them.&nbsp; Him and James.&nbsp; How? . . .&nbsp; Godovius
had offered her terms.&nbsp; From this alone she knew that she
had power to deal with him, to make some sort of bargain, if only
she had time.&nbsp; Time was the thing for which she must
fight.&nbsp; Given time, some happy chance might move them from
Luguru altogether.&nbsp; It seemed that it might even be
necessary for her to receive Godovius&rsquo;s addresses.&nbsp;
Even if it came to that, she was determined to see the matter
through.&nbsp; As the minutes passed, and the strain of the sobs
which she could not control abated, she began to see the whole
matter more clearly.&nbsp; The rainfall, too, was becoming less
intense, and the evenness of her mood was increased by the
peculiar atmosphere of relief which descends on all living
creatures when a tropical sky has been washed with heavy
rain.&nbsp; So strangely was her state of mind modified by the
downpour, that she was almost happy.&nbsp; Now that the storm was
lighter she would be able to run into the house without getting
much more wet, and above all things she was anxious to escape any
ordeal of questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like to get very damp,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She knew that this was his last way of asking
her to tell <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>him what had happened; and if he had pressed her, as he
might easily have done, it is probable that her resolutions would
have vanished and she would have told him.&nbsp; She smiled and
shook her head.&nbsp; In that dim light, under the dripping
<i>banda</i> roof, he looked very pathetic.&nbsp; It occurred to
her that she had better hurry up.&nbsp; Outside it was still
raining, as it might rain in the height of a thunderstorm at
home.&nbsp; The eastern sky was ringed with masses of lurid
yellow cloud.&nbsp; In the garden the hot earth steamed already,
and the rain had washed away the sandy path, which it had been
her pleasant labour to construct.&nbsp; Between her and the house
a tawny torrent ran.&nbsp; She made a rush for the stoep, and
while she ran, with her skirts picked up, she laughed as she
would have done when she was a child running in from the
rain.</p>
<p>The person who felt the strain of this enforced imprisonment
between four walls most deeply was James.&nbsp; Every day of late
he had been gaining strength and looking forward more than ever
to the renewal of his work.&nbsp; He had even been less concerned
with his minor prophets and had picked up from among a heap of
Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s books an account of the life and labours of
his great forerunner, Mackay of Uganda.&nbsp; This book, the work
of the missionary&rsquo;s sister, had impressed him
enormously.&nbsp; It was strange that he had never come across it
before; for the early field of Mackay&rsquo;s splendid failures
had lain upon the edge of the Masai steep, only a few hundred
miles to the northward of Luguru.&nbsp; There, in his collapsible
boat, Mackay had explored the waters of the <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Lukigura
and the greater Wami; there he had first striven with the coastal
Arabs, by whose whips chained gangs of slaves were driven from
the Great Lakes to Bagamoyo and Zanzibar.&nbsp; He read how
Mackay&rsquo;s comrades had died of fever, one by one: how the
missionary himself had been beaten from time to time by that most
cruel land, how he had overcome at last, by virtue of hardihood
and enthusiasm, obstacles far greater than any which had stood in
the steps of the most famous African explorers.&nbsp; It filled
him with a flaming hope to realise that the caravans of shackled
slaves moved no more along the trade routes through M&rsquo;papwa
on their way to the coastal markets; but he knew that a slavery
as degrading was still the lot of peoples such as the Waluguru,
among whom his business lay.</p>
<p>He was very excited about it all, and wanted Eva to read the
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
we have no cause to grumble.&nbsp; A glorious life: a wonderful
death.&nbsp; And yet one can&rsquo;t help feeling that small
isolated peoples like the Waluguru have been left behind.&nbsp;
Missionaries have been eager to get at the intelligent races,
such as the Baganda, and left the more primitive for poor people
such as us.&nbsp; I almost think that our task is more
difficult.&nbsp; There are things I can&rsquo;t understand about
them.&nbsp; It is a privilege to be dealing with virgin soil . .
. and yet . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always when he spoke of virgin soil the old hunter&rsquo;s
warning as to the deadly humours which its disturbance released
returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the rain stops,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall be
able to <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>start work again.&nbsp; Mackay&rsquo;s story has taught
me a lot.&nbsp; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t expect quite so much.&nbsp;
I hope this weather will be over by Sunday.&nbsp; It may change
by then, for on that day there&rsquo;s a new moon.&nbsp; We
always used to say at home that the weather took a turn for the
better or worse when the new moon came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened to him, but only heard the words that he said
without entering into his thoughts.&nbsp; Her own mind was too
full of wondering what she was going to do, always obstinately
hoping that time would show her a way out of her
difficulties.&nbsp; Only occasionally a word would detach itself
from James&rsquo; conversation and startle her by its peculiar
suggestions.&nbsp; Such was his conventional mention of the new
moon.&nbsp; The two words had suddenly thrust his presence into
the full current of her subconscious mind.&nbsp; And the
strangeness of this frightened her.&nbsp; It made her suddenly
want to tell James everything; but when she turned, almost
resolved upon the spur of the moment to do so, she found that the
gleam of intimacy had faded and that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly
do anything of the sort: that James was as distant and precise as
ever, an absolute stranger whom she could never hope to
understand, far more of a stranger even than M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>During the rainy days she saw as much as she dared of
M&lsquo;Crae; but it was hard to find an excuse for going to her
<i>banda</i> in the wet.&nbsp; He suffered there a good deal of
discomfort, which struck her as intolerable, but which he almost
seemed to enjoy.&nbsp; &ldquo;A wonderful thing, rain,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a dry land like <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>this.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;ve lived
longer in Africa you&rsquo;ll know how precious it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to make him as dry and comfortable as she
could.&nbsp; She knew that he was watching her narrowly, felt
that he was waiting for her to tell him all that had happened
with Godovius, but though she knew well enough that she
couldn&rsquo;t keep it up for ever, she didn&rsquo;t see how
matters would be bettered by her telling.&nbsp; In a way it was
almost as well that he shouldn&rsquo;t know how she stood between
him and disaster.&nbsp; If he had asked her. . . .&nbsp; But he
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He had seen on the first night that for some
reason or other she didn&rsquo;t want to take him into her
confidence, and had decided, in pursuance of the peculiarly
delicate code of behaviour which his idealism had invented for
their relation, that it was not for him to press her.&nbsp;
Everything that she did, every one of the little tendernesses by
which she ravished his soul, must be of her own sweet
giving.&nbsp; He had an infinite and touching faith in her simple
wisdom.&nbsp; And it is difficult to say what would have
happened, how this story might have ended, if she had told
him.&nbsp; From the beginning it had been certain that it must
come to an end of violence.&nbsp; It is possible that
M&lsquo;Crae would have killed Godovius.&nbsp; For the sake of
Eva he would certainly have doubled the offence for which he had
lost his name and suffered for so many years.&nbsp; His own life
would have been the last thing which he would have
considered.&nbsp; In the end it <i>was</i> the last thing.</p>

170</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> three days the rain fell so
heavily that the mission lay isolated on its hillside, as surely
as if the country had been submerged by floods.&nbsp; And yet no
waterways appeared.&nbsp; That dry land drank the water as it
fell to reach the hidden channels by which it had drained for
centuries into the central ooze of the M&rsquo;ssente
Swamp.&nbsp; On Sunday, the fourth day, the rain ceased about the
time of a sullen and misty dawn, and by ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning the sun had triumphed.&nbsp; No one would have believed
that any rain had lately fallen; for the bush was full of dry and
brittle sound; the leaves of the undergrowth were of the same
ashen hue; the straggling candelabra cactus stood as withered as
if they were dying of drought; the hornbills were calling on
every side.&nbsp; Only on the higher mountain slopes, where the
grassland had been burnt to a shade of pale amber, a sudden and
surprising flush of the most tender green appeared, as
transitory, alas! as it was beautiful.</p>
<p>There could have been no more lovely or affecting augury for
James&rsquo; return to work.&nbsp; He was up early, walking to
and fro upon the stoep, watching a flight of starlings, whose
glossy plumes shone in flight with the blue of the
kingfisher.&nbsp; The night before he had <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>struggled
through a long conversation with the headman of the nearest
Waluguru village, that circle of squat <i>bandas</i> from which
their own servant, Hamisi, came.&nbsp; He had made it the
occasion of an experiment upon the new lines which his reading of
the life of Mackay had suggested.&nbsp; He had found the man more
curious about the use of the steel carpentering tools with which
the mission was well supplied than any questions of morality or
faith, and when he had gone James had also missed a chisel.&nbsp;
But that didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; It was the price of an
interest which he hadn&rsquo;t imagined to be possible in the
apathetic mind of the Waluguru.&nbsp; He was beginning to see his
way.&nbsp; Even if it meant the sacrifice of some sabbatarian
scruples, he was prepared to go through with it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-morrow, M&rsquo;zinga,&rdquo; he said at parting,
&ldquo;I will show you other things.&nbsp; To-morrow, after the
service at the church.&nbsp; All these things and many more
wonderful you can learn from books.&nbsp; In a little while we
will have a school, and I will teach your totos to read
Swahili.&rdquo;&nbsp; And M&rsquo;zinga had smiled with that
soft, sly smile of Africa . . .</p>
<p>On Sunday mornings, at half-past nine, it had been the
privilege of the boy Hamisi to go down to the chapel and ring the
little bell.&nbsp; It pleased him, for it was a work that needed
little effort; the toy produced an unusual noise and the
performance exalted him above his fellows.&nbsp; At the best it
was a small and pathetic sound in the midst of so great a
wilderness, but very pleasing to the ears of James.&nbsp; This
Sunday morning he was a little restless.&nbsp; As he paced the <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>stoep, with
his Bible in his hands behind his back, the time seemed to pass
more slowly than usual.&nbsp; He looked at his watch.&nbsp; It
was already half-past nine.&nbsp; He called to Eva in the kitchen
to see if his watch was fast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five and twenty to
ten,&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; He was annoyed.&nbsp; The Africans,
no doubt, were sleeping.&nbsp; They would sleep for ever unless
they were disturbed.&nbsp; But Hamisi had never failed him
before.&nbsp; He hurried across the compound to the hut in which
they slept.&nbsp; They were neither of them there.&nbsp; For a
moment he was angry, but then remembered that forbearance was the
better part; that even the best of Africans were
unreliable.&nbsp; Some day a time would come when things would be
different.&nbsp; Until then he must work for himself.</p>
<p>He set off, almost cheerfully, down the sandy path toward the
chapel.&nbsp; The rain had scoured its surface clean of the red
sand and disclosed beneath a mosaic of quartz, pure white and
yellow and stained with garnet-red.&nbsp; The fine crystals
sparkled in the sun.&nbsp; &ldquo;So many hidden wonders,&rdquo;
he thought.&nbsp; It came into his mind that there might even be
precious stones among them.&nbsp; He picked up a little fragment
of pure silicon and held it up to the sun.&nbsp; &ldquo;So many
hidden wonders . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>In the middle of the path, in a pocket of sand round which the
storm water had swirled, one of the lily-like flowers of Africa
had thrust its spiky leaves.&nbsp; The rain and sun had nursed it
into sudden bloom, and the pale cups drooped at his feet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; he <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>thought, &ldquo;the whole world
praises God.&nbsp; Behold the lilies of the field . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first instinct was to pick the flower; but on second
thoughts he had left it, hoping that Eva would see it also on her
way down.&nbsp; He passed for a little while between close walls
of tall grasses on the edge of the bush.&nbsp; Through this
channel a clean wind moved with a silky sound, and its movement
gave to the air, newly washed by rain, a feeling of buoyancy and
freedom, a quality which was almost hopeful.&nbsp; It was a
wonderful thing, he thought, to be alive and well.&nbsp; His soul
was full of thankfulness.</p>
<p>He came at last to the church.&nbsp; Hamisi was not there, and
so he settled down comfortably to toll the bell himself.&nbsp;
The incident would be an amusing one to write home about.&nbsp;
There were many little things like that in Mackay&rsquo;s
letters.&nbsp; From that high slope the note of the bell would
penetrate the edge of the forest, and soon his congregation would
appear, the men in their decent gowns of white, the women in
their shawls of amerikani print, the bright-eyed, pot-bellied
children.&nbsp; And this was a new beginning . . .</p>
<p>He tolled the bell until his watch showed the time to be five
minutes short of the hour, but up to this time none of his
congregation had appeared.&nbsp; He began to feel a little
nervous and puzzled.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t be that he had
mistaken the hour, for the Waluguru took their time from his
chapel bell.&nbsp; He wondered if, by some ridiculous
miscalculation, he had mistaken the day.&nbsp; The idea was
grotesque.&nbsp; And yet when he was ill he had missed two whole
days as completely as if <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>he had been lying dead.&nbsp; No . .
. it couldn&rsquo;t be that.&nbsp; Only the day before he had
verified it.&nbsp; It was Sunday.&nbsp; He remembered the text on
the German calendar, which he had struggled to translate, and
above the number of the day the little concave shape of the new
moon.&nbsp; He remembered telling Eva that the weather would be
likely to change.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock exactly he entered the church.&nbsp; Eva
was sitting there in her usual place; otherwise the building was
empty.&nbsp; It smelt stale and slightly musty with the odour of
black flesh.&nbsp; He remembered suddenly that once before he had
entered an empty church that smelt like that.&nbsp; Where or
when, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine . . . either in some other life
or in a dream.&nbsp; The coincidence made him shiver.</p>
<p>And Eva was sitting there, very pale.&nbsp; When he stalked
past her her lips moved in a piteous shape, as if she wanted to
speak or to cry.&nbsp; But he would not stay for her to
speak.&nbsp; He went straight to his desk and began to read the
form of worship which their own Church prescribed, just as if he
might have been conducting a service in the small stone chapel at
Far Forest.&nbsp; For Eva this was a very terrible
experience.&nbsp; It seemed to her somehow unreasonable to
prolong what she could only think of as an elaborate and insane
pantomime.&nbsp; She felt that, after all, it would have been so
much simpler for her to explain, to take him aside and tell him
that this was nothing but a freakish demonstration of the power
of Godovius, a hint to her of the kind of torture which it would
be easy for him to employ.&nbsp; But James spared <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>her
nothing.&nbsp; Instead of the familiar Swahili words, they sang
together a hymn of Moody and Sankey, which had been a favourite
of her father&rsquo;s, a wearisome business of six long
verses.&nbsp; The performance nearly did for her.&nbsp; All the
time she was ridiculously conscious of the feebleness of their
two voices in that empty, echoing church.&nbsp; She was almost
driven to distraction by the impersonality of James.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Afterwards I will tell him,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; She
wanted to tell him there and then, but the immense force of
tradition restrained her.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
use for her to tell him: for the time he was no longer her
brother&mdash;only a ministering priest rapt in the service of
his Deity.&nbsp; Never in her life had she felt more
irreligious.&nbsp; No vestige of the illusion of religion could
overcome the excitement of her own fear.&nbsp; Reading alternate
verses they recited a psalm of David, a passionate song against
idolaters; and a little of the passion came through into the
voice of James, so that he spoke less precisely than usual, like
a peasant of Far Forest, forgetting the accent which the training
college had taught him.&nbsp; His voice rose and fell and echoed
in the little church:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Insomuch that they worshipped their
idols</i>, <i>which turned to their own decay</i>; <i>yea</i>,
<i>they offered their sons and their daughters unto
devils</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>And
she heard herself reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And shed innocent blood</i>, <i>even the
blood of their sons and their daughters</i>; <i>whom they offered
unto the idols of Canaan</i>; <i>and the land was defiled with
blood</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;heard her own voice, lowered and reverentially
unreal.&nbsp; She supposed that women always spoke like that in
church; as if they were afraid of hurting the words they
spoke.&nbsp; She was thankful when the psalm was over.</p>
<p>And then James prayed.&nbsp; In their denomination the long
extempore prayer was an important part of the service, and
ministers were apt to acquire a rather dangerous fluency.&nbsp;
But that morning James was inspired, if ever a man was inspired,
with religious ecstasy.&nbsp; He wrestled with God.&nbsp; In his
words, in the commonplaces of religious phrase, glowed a passion
to which she could not be wholly insensible.&nbsp; She pitied him
. . . pitied him.&nbsp; It seemed to her that God must surely
pity a man whose soul was so abased and in such agony.&nbsp; At
times he rose to something that was very like eloquence.&nbsp;
One phrase she always remembered.&nbsp; He had been speaking of
Africa&mdash;that sombre and mighty continent and its vast
recesses of gloom&mdash;and then he burst into a sudden and
fervent appeal for light, for a cleansing light which might
penetrate not only Africa but &ldquo;these dark continents of my
heart . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The dark continents of my
heart</i>.&nbsp; Those were the words which she remembered in
after days.</p>
<p>For a little while he knelt in silence, praying, and then,
hurriedly, he left the church before she knew what he was
doing.&nbsp; She put out her hand to detain <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>him, but he
shook his head and said: &ldquo;Not now, Eva, not now . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was left standing alone at the door of the church.&nbsp;
No other soul was near.&nbsp; In the mid-day quiet of the bush
she heard a small bird singing.&nbsp; It was a rain-bird, and its
simple song of three descending notes subtly wooed her dazed mind
to a remembrance of the bells of the little church at Mamble,
whose homely music floats above the wooded valleys to the green
beyond Far Forest.&nbsp; And in a moment of vision she was
assailed by the tender, wistful atmosphere of a Sunday in the
March of Wales, where simple people and children were perhaps at
that moment moving to church between the apple orchards, and men
were standing in their shirt-sleeves at their garden gates.&nbsp;
A gust of warm wind swept through the bush, carrying with it the
odour of aromatic brushwood.&nbsp; It was this scent that broke
and dispelled her dream.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Above all other things James wanted to be alone, not in his
church nor in the horror of the forest, but in his own room at
the mission.&nbsp; He passed swiftly over the path which he had
followed that morning so happily; he entered the empty
mission-house and locked himself in his bedroom.&nbsp; The sudden
disillusionment which had come to him in the empty church had
overwhelmed him; but when the first shock of the incident had
passed and he lay upon his bed, with his <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>hands
pressed to his eyes, conscious only of the extreme heat and of
his throbbing pulse, he suddenly found himself able to think more
clearly.&nbsp; In spite of his passion he was almost calm.&nbsp;
He realised, in the hardest terms, that he was facing a power
which might be the ruin of his mission; that he wasn&rsquo;t
merely opposed by the vast apathy of Africa, but by something
definite and appallingly strong.&nbsp; He saw that his real
troubles were beginning; that, even if he failed, he had got to
fight.&nbsp; It was the first time in his life that he had been
forced to stand with his back to the wall.</p>
<p>Already he had a suspicion of the cause of the trouble.&nbsp;
The problem towards which M&lsquo;Crae had been attracted in his
amateur studies of ethnology by the stories of the Masai was
presented to James for solution, with no evidence beyond the few
dark hints which he had gathered in his work among the Waluguru
and the collateral testimony, the significance of which he had
hardly realised before, present in the only book with which he
was intimately acquainted: his Bible.&nbsp; But already he had
picked up the scent.&nbsp; A lucky mischance, the purest accident
in the world, had arranged that the psalm which he had chosen for
the day&rsquo;s service had been the hundred and sixth.&nbsp; In
the idolatry of the children of Israel, which the Psalmist so
passionately lamented, he found a significant parallel.&nbsp; In
a little while his imagination was at work.&nbsp; He sat at the
table, turning over the worn pages of his Bible, finding
everywhere in the songs <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of the prophets words which
strengthened his incredible surmise.</p>
<p>The new moon. . . .&nbsp; That was the key to his
suspicions.&nbsp; A number of sinister remembrances came to
reinforce the idea.&nbsp; He remembered the young girl in the
Waluguru village who had disappeared about the time of the new
moon.&nbsp; He remembered the story of the boy Onyango, who had
said that on the night of the new moon the Waluguru would kill
him if he were found in the forest.&nbsp; He remembered,
astonished that he should not have noticed it before, the name of
that smooth mountain and of the house of Godovius itself.&nbsp;
The moon. . . .&nbsp; He wondered how he could have been so
blind.&nbsp; And the heathen inhabitants of Canaan worshipped the
moon in abominable rites.&nbsp; Ashtoreth, the Goddess of Groves,
was a moon deity.&nbsp; And Moloch. . . .&nbsp; Who was
Moloch?&nbsp; The Bible would tell him; and most of all his own
passionate prophets.&nbsp; He opened Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Bring no more vain oblations</i>:
<i>incense is an abomination unto me</i>; <i>the new moons and
sabbaths</i>, <i>the calling of assemblies I cannot away
with</i>; <i>it is iniquity</i>, <i>even the solemn
meeting</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul
hateth</i>; <i>they are a trouble to me</i>; <i>I am weary to
bear them</i> . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone was knocking at the door.&nbsp; He supposed it was
Eva.&nbsp; Well, Eva must wait.&nbsp; He was sorry for her; he
would explain later.&nbsp; He came to the door and spoke.&nbsp;
He was astonished at the steadiness of <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>his own
voice.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened and please
don&rsquo;t disturb me.&nbsp; I must be alone to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your door was locked.&nbsp; I wanted to see you if
I could.&nbsp; I want to speak to you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, later. . . .&nbsp; Not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him that his dinner was nearly ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want food,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m doing anything
desperate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I only want to think.&nbsp;
Now be a good girl . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baal and Ashtoreth and Moloch. . . .&nbsp; He wished that he
could go into the library at college and look the business
up.&nbsp; In those days he had never taken that sort of thing
seriously.&nbsp; It had seemed to him so utterly divorced from
the spiritual needs of the present day.</p>
<p>A strange people, the Waluguru.&nbsp; He remembered that once
Godovius had told him that they were of Semitic blood, a remnant
of those Sab&aelig;ans whose queen had corrupted the court of
Solomon, a fair-skinned people who had sailed to Africa for
gold.&nbsp; And Godovius was a Jew. . . .&nbsp; It was plausible,
plausible.&nbsp; And yet, in these days . . .</p>
<p>For all that, the Jews had never failed to be attracted by the
worship of lascivious Syrian deities.&nbsp; Ahaz, he remembered,
who &ldquo;<i>burnt incense in the valley of Hinnom and burnt his
children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen</i>. .
. .&nbsp; <i>He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high
places and on the hills and under every green
tree</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The high places and on the hills . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kilima ja Mweze: the hill of the moon.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>He
remembered the denunciations of the prophet Ezekiel:
&ldquo;<i>For when I brought them into the land for the which I
lifted up my hand to give it to them</i>, <i>then they saw every
high hill and all the thick trees</i>, <i>and they offered there
their sacrifices</i>. . . .&nbsp; <i>Thou hast built thy high
place at the head of every way and hast made thy beauty to be
abhorred</i>, <i>and hast opened thy feet to every one that
passed by</i>, <i>and multiplied thy whoredom</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, with a chilly heart, he passed from these prophecies
to the awful legends of Tophet and the sacrifice of children in
the fires of Moloch.&nbsp; These passages, in their mystery, had
always seemed to him among the most terrible in the Old
Testament.&nbsp; He seemed to remember a lecture in which he had
been told that Moloch was the male counterpart of Ashtoreth or
Astarte, the great goddess of fertility; that the worship of
both, and the licentious rites with which their mysteries were
celebrated on Syrian hill-tops, were really ceremonies of
homoeopathic magic by the practice of which the fertility of
fields and cattle might be increased.</p>
<p>So far, at any rate, the planter, Godovius, if he believed in
any such superstitions, had an object.&nbsp; But there must be
more in it than this.&nbsp; It was possible that in his
r&ocirc;le of hierophant he might be able to exert a more
terrible power over his slaves, the Waluguru.&nbsp; A man will do
almost anything for the lust of power; and one presupposed that
Godovius was in some way a psychopathic and a megalomaniac.&nbsp;
Those were the two types of mind in which the moral <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>decadence
of modern Germany had been most productive.&nbsp; Was this the
ecstasy which had won him the name of Sakharani?&nbsp; Or was it
a simpler, more crudely carnal passion, for which this worship
gave him an excuse, a celebration of those phallic rites with
which the Cilician high places had been defiled?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, at any rate, I shall know,&rdquo; he
thought.&nbsp; Perhaps the Waluguru, whom the boy Onyango had
feared, would kill him, before he had surprised their
secret.&nbsp; For a long time he lay on his bed contemplating the
dangers of his new duty.&nbsp; And then, for a long time, he
prayed.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Now, at any cost, he was determined to see for himself.&nbsp;
Nothing must stand between him and his duty.&nbsp; This was a
man&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; He decided that Eva must have no part in
it; and so, a little later in the afternoon, when the fiercer
heat of the day was waning, he left his locked room by way of the
folding windows and took his way towards the forest.&nbsp; This
time he went there with none of the vague terrors which had
troubled him before: apart from a suspicion of shame in his
deliberate secrecy, he had no misgivings.&nbsp; He was happy to
find himself so firm in his purpose, thankful that the fever had
left him free to meet this ordeal.</p>
<p>By the time of sunset he had reached the edge of the forest,
in the very hour at which its life awakened.&nbsp; As he passed
into its shadow he was conscious of this, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>as of a
faint stirring in many millions of awakened leaves suddenly aware
of his presence.&nbsp; In this he found nothing sinister.&nbsp;
He was only filled with a wonder which had never come to him in
moments less intense at the existence of these countless
multitudes of green living creatures to whom the power of motion
was denied.&nbsp; He was impressed with the patience and
helplessness of vegetable life, seeing an aged and enormous tree
strangled where it grew by the writhing coils of some green
parasite.&nbsp; And yet it seemed to him that life must be far
easier for a tree than for a man.&nbsp; A light breeze, herald of
the evening, threw the plumes of the forest edge into tossing
confusion.&nbsp; The ways of the wood were full of gentle
sound.</p>
<p>And suddenly it was dark.&nbsp; He was on the edge of the
nearest Waluguru village, the home of the mission boy,
Hamisi.&nbsp; He did not want all the people of the forest to
know of his errand; but blundering in the dark he found himself
under the shadow of their <i>bandas</i>, and seeing that
concealment was useless, he entered the circle of the
village.&nbsp; The sound of his step set up a small commotion
among their goats, who were folded within a <i>boma</i> of
thorns, but no human shape came to welcome him in the
village.&nbsp; He went to the door of the headman&rsquo;s hut,
expecting to find the man M&rsquo;zinga, who had stolen his
chisel.&nbsp; But M&rsquo;zinga was not there, nor any of the
wives of M&rsquo;zinga.&nbsp; And this struck him as strange; for
only a little time before the youngest of these women had given
birth to a baby, whom it was his ambition to <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>baptize.&nbsp; He tried another hut.&nbsp; All were
empty.&nbsp; The village was empty and stank more foully than if
it had been crammed with Waluguru.&nbsp; It was as if some plague
had stricken its people, leaving nothing behind but the stench of
corruption.</p>
<p>He pushed on.&nbsp; In a little while he came to the
M&rsquo;ssente river, whose crossings he now knew so well.&nbsp;
By this time his eyes were becoming accustomed to the gloom of
the forest, so that when he came to the felled tree which served
him for a bridge he was astonished at the amount of light which
still lingered in the sky and its faint reflections cast upwards
from that swift, dark water.&nbsp; Lingering here a moment,
entranced by the sound of the stream and the glimpse of open sky,
his eye was surprised by a sudden gleam of silver.&nbsp; It was
the broken image of the new moon&rsquo;s silver sickle.&nbsp; He
raised his eyes to the sky in which that pale and lovely shape
was rising.&nbsp; He watched her sailing upwards through the
indigo air.&nbsp; And while he watched, it seemed to him that
other eyes must have seen her.&nbsp; In the distance, over
towards Kilima ja Mweze, he heard the throbbing of a drum.</p>
<p>At length he came to the village at which he had first
surprised the devil dance.&nbsp; This, too, was empty, empty and
stinking.&nbsp; He wondered why it was that Waluguru villages
smelt so horrible at night.&nbsp; Where had the people of all
these villages assembled?&nbsp; The words of Isaiah returned to
him: &ldquo;<i>The new moons and sabbaths</i>, <i>the calling of
assemblies I cannot away with</i>.&nbsp; <i>Your new moons and
your appointed feasts my soul hateth</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
baffling sound of drums <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>drew nearer.&nbsp; On every side he
heard the throbbing of drums.&nbsp; It was as though all the
drums of Africa had been gathered together for this
assembly.&nbsp; Every moment it seemed to him that the night grew
more suffocating.&nbsp; He felt afraid of the darkness, as
children are afraid. . . .</p>
<p>He had come to that thinner zone of the forest in which the
terraced walks which had puzzled Eva began.&nbsp; And now it
seemed to him that the wood was full of more than shadows.&nbsp;
On every side of him, in the darkness, he heard the rustle of
bodies moving through the leaves.&nbsp; He was conscious of the
smell of the castor oil with which the Waluguru smear their
limbs.&nbsp; Sometimes he heard the sound of heavy breathing and
once or twice a laugh or a stifled cry.&nbsp; A terrible and
bewildering experience.&nbsp; He could see nothing; and yet he
knew that the darkness was crowded with men and women hurrying to
and fro, who heeded him no more than if he had been a shadow, and
were as intangible as shadows themselves.</p>
<p>Nor was this all; for it seemed to him that this atmosphere of
hidden evil&mdash;for assuredly it was a devilish
thing&mdash;aroused in him a curious excitement.&nbsp; It was as
though there were in his composition nerve-endings of which his
senses had never been cognisant, and his mind never master, which
were responding against his will to these ancient and most subtle
stimuli.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t feel sure of the self of which he
thought he had explored the utmost hidden recesses.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was the hypnotic influence of the drums&rsquo; <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>monotonous
rhythm; perhaps some special enchantment hidden in this darkness
full of whispers and breathings and stifled cries.&nbsp; He
understood now what the old writers had experienced when they
invented a devil, an incarnation of the spirit of evil.&nbsp; He
wanted to turn his back and run away from the whole
adventure.&nbsp; He lay in the grass and prayed.</p>
<p>Thus fortified, he struggled on, climbing the zigzag path
which skirted the Sab&aelig;an terraces.&nbsp; In the act of
climbing he was happily less conscious of that populous
darkness.&nbsp; In front of him many lights flickered through the
trees.&nbsp; The noise of the drums grew very near.&nbsp;
Suddenly, rounding a corner in the twisting way, he found himself
on the edge of an open expanse, a wide shoulder of the hill, from
which the light had come.&nbsp; For fear of being discovered he
dropped down on his stomach in the grass.&nbsp; He slipped, and
the blades at which he clutched cut his hands.&nbsp; In the
middle of that shoulder of the hill stood the circular building
of undressed stone which had astonished Eva on the night of her
visit to the House of the Moon; but here there was no longer
mystery or desertion; the open ground was crowded with black men
and women.&nbsp; From his place of concealment in the spear-grass
he could look straight through the gateway in the outer wall to
the circular kiln which rose in the centre of the building.&nbsp;
Here a fierce fire of wood was burning, the core, indeed, of all
that buzzing activity.&nbsp; Towards it the men and women of the
Waluguru, whom he had heard moving and panting in the darkness,
were carrying bundles of dry <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>fuel.&nbsp; They ran to and fro like
the black ants, which the Swahili call <i>maji ya moto</i>
(boiling water), from the seething noise which they make when
they are disturbed.&nbsp; Even so this welter of the Waluguru
boiled and sweated; and to add to the fantastic horror of the
scene, which resembled some ancient picture of a corner in hell,
the flames in the central kiln crackled and flared, casting
immense shadows from the black forms which leapt around them,
flinging tongues of light to search the dark sky and lighten the
swaying crowns of the forest trees.&nbsp; Sometimes, in this
upper darkness, the vagrant lights would pick out the wings of
pale birds that fluttered there.&nbsp; These were the doves which
had nested within crevices of the walls.</p>
<p>But what most deeply filled the heart of James with dread was
the expression of the faces of the naked men and women who danced
about the flame.&nbsp; They were not the faces, the pitiable
human masks of the Waluguru, but the faces of devils.&nbsp; He
saw the transformed features of men whom he knew well: the mouth
of the mission boy Hamisi, opened wide in horrible laughter, the
red eyes of the headman, M&rsquo;zinga.&nbsp; M&rsquo;zinga was
carrying the stolen chisel, waving it as his muscles twitched to
the rhythm of the drums.&nbsp; He danced right up to the mouth of
the kiln, then suddenly collapsed before it, hacking at himself
with the sharpened edge till his legs streamed with blood.&nbsp;
James could not see the end of this horror, for a company of
sweating fuel-bearers from the depths of the forest swarmed
before him, pushing the crowd to right and left.&nbsp; They threw
the branches <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>which they had carried on the fire.&nbsp; There
followed a hissing of sap, for the boughs were green, and a cloud
of smoke spouted from the chimney of the kiln.&nbsp; At the
crackling of the furnace the fuel-bearers shouted for joy,
scattering in the crowd of women, some of whom they dragged away
into the edge of the forest.&nbsp; The acrid wood-smoke made the
eyes of James smart.</p>
<p>And now the furnace was so heated that the stones which lined
it shone with a white heat.&nbsp; No more loads of fuel were
brought to it from the outer woods, and though the drumming never
ceased, it seemed as though the wilder ecstasy of the dancers had
worn itself out.&nbsp; They lay stretched out, many of them, on
the sandy ground in attitudes of abandonment and fatigue, their
sweaty bodies shining like wet ebony.&nbsp; James noticed a thing
which he had not seen before: a group of women, swathed in the
black cloth, which the Waluguru affect, who had been sitting
patiently on the right hand of the opening in the temple
wall.&nbsp; The nearest of them he recognised as that slim girl
the wife of the headman M&rsquo;zinga; in her arms, held tightly
to her breast, she carried her baby.&nbsp; From time to time she
covered it with her black cotton cloth to shield its face from
the scorching fire.</p>
<p>Already James had guessed what was coming.&nbsp; Standing at
the side of the furnace door, he saw a tall man in white.&nbsp;
He heard a whisper of the word <i>Sakharani</i> . . .
<i>Sakharani</i>.&nbsp; In a moment another figure had leapt out
into the light.&nbsp; It was the headman, M&rsquo;zinga, still
dripping blood from his most terrible <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>mutilation.&nbsp; He pulled his baby
from the arms of its mother.&nbsp; She clung to it, but the other
women tore at her arms, and the rest of the Waluguru
snarled.&nbsp; He held the child high above his head in the face
of the furnace.&nbsp; The Waluguru shouted.&nbsp; For the moment
the sacrifice of Ashtoreth was forgotten.&nbsp; And the white
figure of Godovius was Moloch, the king.</p>

190</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Eva, resolved on confession,
had come to the door of her brother&rsquo;s room and knocked, she
had not been altogether surprised at his anxiety to be left
alone.&nbsp; James had always been like that, and she knew that
there was nothing to be gained by disturbing him.&nbsp; Through
the heat of that peerless afternoon she waited.&nbsp; But when
the evening came and he had not yet emerged from his chosen
solitude, she began to be more anxious.&nbsp; Even if he were in
a state of extreme spiritual depression, starvation
wouldn&rsquo;t improve matters.&nbsp; It had always been a great
part of her function in life to see that he was properly supplied
with food and raiment and all the physical comforts which his
spirit so heartily despised, and even in this extremity her
thoughts moved in the accustomed channel.&nbsp; Seeing herself,
as from a distance, pursuing these eminently practical affairs,
she was even faintly thankful that she had still the distraction
of her habitual activities.&nbsp; She went into the garden to
find the boys.&nbsp; Onyango was there alone, sleeping in the
sun.&nbsp; She woke him, and in a little while he returned,
bringing with him a yellow gourd full of the thin milk of the
country.&nbsp; She boiled a little of this over her fire of
sticks, and took it to the <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>door of James&rsquo; room.&nbsp;
This time there was no answer.&nbsp; Perhaps, she thought, he was
asleep.&nbsp; A blessed relief from all his troubles.</p>
<p>Two hours later she knocked again, and when, again, she
received no reply, she suddenly took fright.&nbsp; She
wasn&rsquo;t afraid that he had done anything very desperate: she
knew that his religious sense was too strong for this: but she
knew that he was the lightest of sleepers, and his silence
suggested to her a return of the illness which had robbed him of
consciousness before.&nbsp; She remembered so well the ghastly
sight which he had presented to her on that day, when he had laid
on his back with his eyes staring at the ceiling, breathing
stertorously.&nbsp; She listened carefully at the door, trying to
hear if he were breathing like that now.&nbsp; She remembered her
despair on that terrible night and the callous unconcern of
Godovius, and her thoughts turned gratefully to
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; Now, thank heaven, she was not quite
alone.&nbsp; She tried the door and found that it was
bolted.&nbsp; The window. . . .&nbsp; It opened on to the stoep
at the place where the great bougainvillea hung in thick
festoons, mitigating kindly the whiteness of the light.&nbsp; At
her passage a flight of nectarinid&aelig; passed with whirring
wings.&nbsp; The window stood open.&nbsp; The room was empty . .
. that little room of James&rsquo;, pathetic in its bareness,
with no ornamentation but a cabinet photograph of old Aaron
Burwarton and the coloured texts which James himself had achieved
in his schooldays.&nbsp; On the table lay the open Bible and a
sheet of paper on which James had scribbled texts.&nbsp; If she
had looked up the <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>references she might have discovered a series of
obvious clues to the mystery of his new adventure.&nbsp; But she
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She folded the paper and closed the
Bible.&nbsp; She saw that he had lain on the bed, and even while
she wondered what could have happened to him, she was smoothing
the sheets and putting the creased bedclothes in order.&nbsp; She
was only thankful that he was not ill.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t so
much concern her where he had gone; for it was a very rare thing
for James to invite her confidence in his plans.&nbsp; Even at
Far Forest he would often annoy her by an air of secrecy which
emphasised his importance.&nbsp; So when she had put his room,
that scene of so recent a spiritual anguish, in order, she
sighed, and returned to the kitchen with her cup of milk.</p>
<p>All that afternoon she did not go to M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; Since
the day on which Godovius had threatened her she had never been
quite comfortable with him.&nbsp; She had felt an awkwardness
which it was hard to explain: almost as if M&lsquo;Crae were
aware of the character which Godovius had given to their
relation.&nbsp; In some subtle way it seemed that the frankness
of their first friendship had been spoiled.&nbsp; That was how
she put it to herself; but the more probable reason for their
awkwardness was the fact that he knew that she was excluding him
from her confidence and would not say so.&nbsp; She would not
admit to herself that she, more directly than Godovius, was
responsible for the strained atmosphere.</p>
<p>In a very little while night fell.&nbsp; Still James did not
come; and this seemed to her unusual, for the thorn <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>bush about
Luguru is no place for a man to wander in at night.&nbsp; From
her chair in front of their living-room window on the stoep she
watched the rising of the moon.&nbsp; At that very moment James
was crossing the M&rsquo;ssente River.&nbsp; A beautiful slip of
a thing she seemed to Eva, and of an amazing brilliance.&nbsp;
Even before her shining sickle had floated above Kilima ja Mweze
the sky was flooded with a pale radiance, and the outlines of the
trees which climbed the sky-line and had already been merged in
the soft darkness of the mountain&rsquo;s bulk grew suddenly
distinct. . . .&nbsp; Then the restless noises of the night
began.&nbsp; Eva felt suddenly and rather hopelessly alone.&nbsp;
She was not very happy in the dark.</p>
<p>Now she would not have to wait very long for James.&nbsp; No
doubt, too, he would be hungry.&nbsp; She went into the house and
laid the table for supper.&nbsp; After all, one must eat.&nbsp;
On the table she placed a single lighted candle.&nbsp; Then she
pulled on a pair of leather mosquito boots to protect her ankles,
and sat there, waiting, and listening to the night.&nbsp; Far
away in the forest she heard the sound of drumming.&nbsp; It did
not bring to her mind the sinister suggestions with which it
troubled that of James.&nbsp; But she felt unhappy, and, somehow,
a little cold.&nbsp; She found herself shivering.&nbsp; And just
as she had begun to wonder if she, like James, were on the edge
of the inevitable fever, a strong-winged moth, hurling out of the
darkness at her candle, put out the flame, with a noise of
singeing wings, and left her in darkness.</p>
<p>It was a small thing, but it frightened her.&nbsp; She <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>relighted
the candle and settled down again to waiting for James; but now
she found it more difficult than before to be
self-contained.&nbsp; Indeed this culmination to her long
day&rsquo;s anxiety had been rather too much for her; she had
tried too daringly to walk alone.&nbsp; The incident of the empty
church, which at first had seemed to her no more than a set-back
to be encountered, now returned to her with a more sinister
suggestion.&nbsp; All atmospheres of that kind are more
formidable by night: and this night of Africa, with its high and
velvety sky in which the crescent moon was still ascending,
seemed peculiarly vast, and alien in its vastness.&nbsp; All the
time, from the recesses of the forest, she heard the beating of
drums.</p>
<p>The little clock on the mantelpiece struck eight.&nbsp; The
candle on the supper-table was burning down with a steady
flame.&nbsp; James had never in all their life at Luguru been as
late as this.&nbsp; It occurred to her that perhaps she was
feeling nervous just for want of food.&nbsp; She decided that at
the very worst she would not have to wait much longer, and that
in any case it would be foolish to give way to her fancies.&nbsp;
And then, at a moment when she was really feeling more secure,
fear came to her, as swiftly and blindly as the moth which had
blundered in out of the night, and all her bravery was
extinguished.&nbsp; She left the light burning in the room and
ran along the garden path to M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s
<i>banda</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened,&rdquo; she told him, quite
simply.&nbsp; And then she told him of the surprise at the church
that morning; of how James had left her and locked <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>himself in
his room; how he had left the mission and had not yet
returned.&nbsp; And when once she had begun to tell him these
things, and had heard his grave replies in a voice that was
steady and devoid of fear, she began to feel lighter and
happier.&nbsp; When once she had managed to talk like this she
found it wonderfully easy to go on, and in a little while she had
unbosomed herself of the whole story of her meeting with
Godovius, his entreaties and his threats.&nbsp; Until she had
ended he did not speak; but she knew that it was with difficulty
that he heard her through.&nbsp; At the end he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have told me.&nbsp; It would have been more
like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know . . .&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps I was ashamed.&nbsp; I think I <i>was</i>
ashamed.&nbsp; At the suggestion . . . you know . . . that we
were anything but friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a short laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing at
you,&rdquo; he said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; It was silly of
me.&nbsp; I ought to have trusted you.&nbsp; I wanted to.&nbsp;
But I was shy, I suppose.&nbsp; And shocked by the mistake that
he&rsquo;d made.&nbsp; I was afraid that you might suffer because
of his mistaken idea.&nbsp; And I was selfish.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of your not being here: and I
thought that I could somehow wait until things cleared up.&nbsp;
I thought I could just keep it to myself and hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wrong.&nbsp; It never pays to put things
off.&nbsp; No doubt it was a shock for you to have it taken for
granted that I had made love to you.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>have you
worried by that.&nbsp; I suppose I am old enough to be your
father.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t think any more of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite candidly she said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was no more than he expected.</p>
<p>She sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am happier now,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I have gone
through in these days.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then her thoughts
returned suddenly to her fears for James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me what to do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel
as if I can do any more thinking.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been such a
failure when I tried to do it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe I can feel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not like a woman
at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m callous.&nbsp; No . . . I&rsquo;m not
really callous, but awfully tired.&nbsp; Oh, what can we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done in the night,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where he went.&nbsp;
In the night we are quite helpless.&nbsp; On the night when you
found me it was just a matter of luck . . . a matter of
Providence.&nbsp; When you get to my age you begin to believe in
Providence.&nbsp; If you are lonely or frightened you had better
stay here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frightened now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But . . . but I think I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae made room for her on the heap of sisal beside
him.&nbsp; They sat there for a long time without speaking amid
the restless sounds which passed for silence in that night.&nbsp;
In the remotest distance they heard the drums at Kilima ja
Mweze.&nbsp; They were like the beating of a savage heart.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have kept it all to
myself,&rdquo; she said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you very angry
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a long time answering her childishness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t be angry with you.&nbsp; You should have known
that.&nbsp; But if I had heard what he said to you I should have
killed him.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have missed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m thankful you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the long silence which followed her tiredness gradually
overcame her.&nbsp; It was no great wonder that in a little while
she fell asleep.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae, lying beside her, felt her
tired limbs twitch from time to time, as the muscles, conscious
of the brain&rsquo;s waning control, tried to keep awake.&nbsp;
These feeble movements aroused in M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s mind an
emotion which was nearer to pity than to anything else.&nbsp;
They reminded him of the helpless incoordinate movements which he
had often seen in the limbs of young animals.&nbsp; He pitied her
childishness, and loved it; for he had come to an age in which
youth seems the most pathetic and beautiful of all things.&nbsp;
Gradually this restlessness ceased.&nbsp; Eva sighed in her
sleep, and the hand which lay nearest to him slipped down until
it touched his bare arm.&nbsp; In its unconsciousness the action
was as tender as a caress.&nbsp; He permitted himself to be
conscious of the hand&rsquo;s slenderness; but it seemed to him
very cold.&nbsp; Gently, without disturbing her slumber, he
lifted with his foot the blanket which she had lent him and
pushed it over her.&nbsp; Then, lying still in the same cramped
position, he settled down to think.</p>
<h3><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>II</h3>
<p>It was plain to M&lsquo;Crae from the noise of drumming which
had filled the forest all that evening that some great festival
was in progress at the Hill of the Moon.&nbsp; Lying awake in his
<i>banda</i>, he listened to the sound.&nbsp; It accompanied,
with its bourdon of menace, all the deliberations of that
night.&nbsp; It was now evident to him that if a way were to be
found out of Eva&rsquo;s difficulties he must find it himself;
and though he had fought his way often enough out of a tight
corner, he had never been faced with a problem of equal
delicacy.&nbsp; On the face of it, the matter seemed
insoluble.&nbsp; In the first place, he could not count on James
for any behaviour that was not admirably perverse.&nbsp; In any
project of escape James counted for so much dead weight.&nbsp;
Again, even if James should not return from his adventure on this
night&mdash;and there was no reason to suppose that he would not
do so&mdash;M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s peculiar position as a man
&ldquo;wanted&rdquo; by the German Colonial Government made it
impossible for him to be a free agent.&nbsp; Here, as in most
things, Godovius had the whip-hand, and however gallantly
M&lsquo;Crae might have desired to play the knight-errant in the
case of Eva, it would always be doubtful if her association with
him could be of any use.&nbsp; It might even be better for her if
he were to disappear, as a man with his knowledge of bushcraft
might conceivably do, and leave her unhampered by his unfortunate
association.&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>do
that.&nbsp; For if he left her, only James would remain, and of
what use in the world was James?</p>
<p>Thinking the matter over coldly and with deliberation, he
regretted that he had not been able to hear the shameful
suggestions of Godovius on the evening of the rains; for if he
had heard him he would assuredly have shot him where he stood,
and the world would have been rid of another wild animal, as
savage as any beast in the bush but without any redeeming dower
of beauty.&nbsp; He would have shot him.&nbsp; There would have
been another murder to his account.&nbsp; But this time he would
not have needed to change his name, to lie hidden in an opium
house or ship furtively under a strange flag.&nbsp; No . . . the
matter would have been far simpler.&nbsp; He would have stepped
out into the bush a free man, and then the vastness of Central
Africa would have swallowed him up, him and his name.&nbsp; He
would have trekked to recesses where no European could have found
him.&nbsp; He would simply have disappeared.&nbsp; Perhaps he
would have lived for many years: the M&lsquo;Craes were a
long-lived race.&nbsp; Perhaps he would have died soon and in
violence: it would have made no difference.&nbsp; The life which
he would have led would not have been very much more solitary
than his life had been for the last thirty years, except for one
thing&mdash;the fact that he would be condemned to it for
ever.&nbsp; And here, even though his love for Africa was so vast
and varied, he found that there was more to renounce than he
would have believed.&nbsp; For many years, as he had told Eva,
the memory of his early life in Arran had <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>been
nothing more to him than a memory: he had never really hoped to
return to her misty beauty.&nbsp; But now, when he found himself
faced by an absolute renunciation of the possibility of
returning, he couldn&rsquo;t quite face it.&nbsp; The sacrifice
would be as final as death.&nbsp; For a short moment he was
troubled by a vision of his ancient home: a day, as chance would
have it, of lashing rain without and the smell of peat
within.&nbsp; And he knew that if he did return he would have no
more part or lot in the life of that remote island than a ghost
revisiting the haunt of vanished love.&nbsp; For a little while
the picture held his fancy: and then, imperceptibly, faded.&nbsp;
The huge insistence of the tropical night, the high note of the
cicalas, the whistling of the frogs rejoicing in the vanishing
moisture of the rains, recalled him to the life which he had
chosen, and he realised how imponderable was his dream.&nbsp; If
he had killed Godovius that dream must have been
surrendered.&nbsp; Very well . . . let it go.&nbsp; Even now it
might be that he would have to kill Godovius . . .</p>
<p>He wished that he could smoke.&nbsp; Such meditations as these
were less easy without tobacco.&nbsp; His tobacco hung in a
yellow canvas bag at his belt, but his pipe was in his pocket,
and in any case his hand was not free, for Eva&rsquo;s fingers
lay upon his arm, and she, poor child, must sleep.&nbsp; By this
time his eyes were so accustomed to the dim light of the
<i>banda</i>, now faintly illumined by starlight and the beams of
the rising moon, that he could see every feature of her pale face
and the gloom of her hair.&nbsp; He had never <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>before been
able really to see Eva&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; In the daylight the
candour of her eyes would have abashed him; he would not have
dared to look at her eyes.&nbsp; Now he saw how much her beauty
meant to him.&nbsp; If he should kill Godovius he would never see
her again . . .</p>
<p>Against this final cruelty his spirit rebelled.&nbsp; It was
not for nothing that he had been brought up in the hard creed of
Calvinism.&nbsp; Here, even in spite of the new beliefs which
life had taught him so bitterly, he found himself instinctively
remembering the words of the Old Testament, and the brand of the
murderer Cain, whose fate it had been to wander to and fro upon
the face of the earth.&nbsp; So deeply ingrained in his mind were
the teachings of his childhood that he was almost ready to accept
this cruelty as justice: a kind of religious justice which
decreed that if he were to save her loveliness from the
defilement of Godovius he must relinquish for ever the one
surpassing revelation of beauty which had crowned his
wanderings.</p>
<p>Even so it seemed probable that he would have to kill
Godovius.&nbsp; There was no other way out of it.&nbsp; At his
side lay his rifle.&nbsp; The chambers were loaded with
soft-nosed four-fifty bullets.&nbsp; He remembered the scandals
which centred in the soft-nosed bullet in the Boer War.&nbsp; A
bullet of that kind inflicted terrible wounds.&nbsp; That
wouldn&rsquo;t matter if only he shot straight: and there was no
fear of his missing, for his rifle was almost part of his maimed
body.</p>
<p>Eva stirred very gently in her sleep.&nbsp; She made a <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>strange
choking noise that was like a sob.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s
fingers grasped her hand.&nbsp; He had never done anything like
that before: but it seemed natural to take hold of the hand of a
child who was frightened in the dark.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was past midnight when the stillness of the night was
broken by the sound of Africans grunting beneath a burden and the
clatter of many tongues.&nbsp; In the front of the mission there
was a great commotion and M&lsquo;Crae roused Eva from her
sleep.&nbsp; Now that the game of secrecy was over there seemed
to be no point in concealment; and Eva was far too sleepy to
question what he did.&nbsp; They stepped out together into the
pale night.&nbsp; The sky was very high and clear, but immense
billows of milky cloud were ranged along the hill horizons, which
in their huge whiteness overpowered the little earth.&nbsp;
Beneath the stoep a crowd of Waluguru were setting up a
<i>kelele</i>.&nbsp; Most of them were naked and their polished
skins shone in the moonlight.&nbsp; They swarmed like black ants
about a piece of carrion, and the body which they had dragged
from the forest to the mission was that of James, bleeding and
torn by the thorns of the bush and smothered in red dust.&nbsp;
Hamisi, who appeared to be in charge of the expedition, was loud
and anxious in explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hapana kufa. . . .&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; he
hastened to tell them.&nbsp; Sakharani, he said, had sent him
home.&nbsp; He <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>had been found unconscious in the forest: even now he
was unconscious, but breathing, and alive.</p>
<p>Now, at any rate, he had little chance of air, so completely
was he surrounded by the sweating Waluguru.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae
told them to go back to the forest.&nbsp; Already Eva was
kneeling at her brother&rsquo;s side, while the boy Hamisi,
pleased with the importance of his mission, grinned and repeated
the words: &ldquo;Hapana kufa. . . .&nbsp; Hapana kufa. . .
.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t dead, but, for all that, a very ghastly
sight.&nbsp; His face was deadly pale and smeared with the blood
that had trickled from a split in the skin above his right
eyebrow.&nbsp; His right eye was full of blood.&nbsp; The blow
must have stunned him fairly effectually, or else the rough
journey would have awakened him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get him into the house,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; He saw Eva help Hamisi to lift him and cursed
his own maimed strength.&nbsp; It was beautiful of her, he
thought, that she should consent to do such things.&nbsp; They
lifted him and dragged him to his own room, and laid him on the
bed.&nbsp; Eva brought a bowl of water from the kitchen and
bathed his head.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae, miserably helpless,
questioned Hamisi.</p>
<p>Bwana N&rsquo;gombe (James), he said, had been found in the
forest near Kilima ja Mweze.&nbsp; The cut on the head was
nothing.&nbsp; Perhaps he had fallen against a tree.&nbsp;
Perhaps a leopard had torn him.&nbsp; They had found him lying in
the grass.&nbsp; Lying asleep.&nbsp; Even now he was
asleep.&nbsp; Hamisi relapsed again into his monotonous
&ldquo;Hapana kufa. . . .&nbsp; Hapana kufa.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Perhaps he
had gone to sleep for want of blood.&nbsp; Perhaps a devil had
done it.&nbsp; He knew nothing whatever about it.&nbsp; He only
knew that the man had been picked up asleep in the grass and that
Sakharani had told them to carry him home.&nbsp; And here he
was.&nbsp; Hamisi grinned, being satisfied that he had taken part
in an excellent piece of work.</p>
<p>All the time that M&lsquo;Crae was questioning the Waluguru he
had his eye on Eva.&nbsp; He watched the splendid way (as he
thought) in which she suddenly adapted herself to the demands of
the moment.&nbsp; Once again, as on the night when he had
staggered out to waylay her, she was showing him her deft,
practical side: the aspect which appeals most strongly to a man
who has made a woman the vehicle of a tender ideal.&nbsp; It
reminded him of that first night.&nbsp; It pleased him that it
should do so, and so he kept Hamisi talking, and tried lovingly
to recover the atmosphere of their first meeting, thinking:
&ldquo;You wonderful woman . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He packed Hamisi off to bed in his smoky hole.&nbsp; He and
Eva together stripped James of his torn and muddy clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see he has been through the swamp,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>It pleased him to find that he could use his arm with very
little discomfort now, and the sense of helplessness which had
lain upon him so heavily in the <i>banda</i> disappeared.&nbsp;
It was difficult to realise that he had led the life of a
prisoner in a dungeon for a month.&nbsp; And Eva, too, was amazed
at the help which he gave her, for she had grown to think of him
as <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>a
helpless and pitiable creature.&nbsp; When she had started to
undress James she had not imagined that the task would be so
difficult.&nbsp; The weight of his unconscious body surprised
her.&nbsp; A poor, thin creature, wasted by fever . . . he looked
as though she could easily pick him up in her arms.&nbsp; But she
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Even with the help of M&lsquo;Crae it was a
struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good wasting your strength,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better slit up the
sleeve.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she went to her room and fetched a pair
of scissors, and then M&lsquo;Crae found himself watching her
slim, capable fingers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you now,&rdquo; he said, and was
rewarded by her smile.</p>
<p>They sat there for a long time together, speaking in whispers,
as if they were afraid of waking James, although, in fact, they
were most anxious that he should wake.&nbsp; It was a very
strange night for M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; Removed at last from the
gloom of the <i>banda</i>, it seemed to him that he had never
really seen Eva before.&nbsp; In this light and spacious room she
was quite a different creature from the gentle presence which had
haunted his prison; endowed, in some way, with a more beautiful
freedom of movement . . . more alive.&nbsp; More hopelessly
unattainable.&nbsp; But it was ridiculous on the face of it that
she should occur to him in these terms.&nbsp; He thrust the fancy
aside obstinately, only to find it obstinately return.&nbsp; For
why in the world should he not enjoy this brief interlude of
beauty and light, seeing that in a very little time, a few days .
. . perhaps a few hours, he himself must vanish altogether into a
darkness from which he would <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>never emerge?&nbsp; For, without any
doubt, he must kill Godovius.&nbsp; There was no way out of
that.</p>
<p>At length, a little time before the dawn, when the night was
at its coldest, James stirred in his bed.&nbsp; His hand
uncertainly sought his bandaged head, and Eva very tenderly
guided it downwards and laid it beneath the blanket.&nbsp; The
movement was an immense relief to both of them.&nbsp; Neither of
them spoke; and yet M&lsquo;Crae could see that a shadow had been
lifted from her face.</p>
<p>And now James became increasingly restless.&nbsp; Once or
twice he gave a groan of pain, and then a deep sigh, almost a
sigh of content.&nbsp; He tried to lift himself up in the bed,
though Eva gently restrained him.&nbsp; At last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have left it behind . . . in the church . . . it
is so light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to open his eyes.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae could see his
brows wrinkling beneath the bandage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too light . .
.&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae moved the lamp further away from the bed.&nbsp;
His footsteps disturbed James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? . . .&nbsp; There&rsquo;s somebody
there,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my poor head . . . my
poor head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eva laid her hand lightly upon his forehead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, dear, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>For a little while he was contented; but then he said again:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone else in the room. . . .&nbsp; Who is
it?&nbsp; <i>He</i> isn&rsquo;t here, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in this dazed condition he was typically persistent.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody there . . . who is
it?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re keeping it from me.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
fair.&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eva&rsquo;s voice trembled as she answered.&nbsp; She was
listening to her own voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a friend,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend? . . .&nbsp; We have no friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stranger.&nbsp; A Mr. M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; A hunter
who was lost near here and came to the mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a long silence.&nbsp; She was dreading what
would come next.&nbsp; To her relief she found that he was
treating it as a matter of course.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Oh . . . all right.&nbsp; My head does ache
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Eva breathed freely.&nbsp; No doubt it was
strange that she should be so relieved; but the difficulty which
she had dreaded most in James&rsquo; awakening had been his
discovery of M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; From the very
first she had wondered how he would take it.&nbsp; She had feared
that his peculiarly jealous regard for all strangers, a thing
which he had overcome with difficulty in his youth, would be too
much for him.&nbsp; The anticipation of this had been bad enough;
but after her interview with Godovius, and his most hateful
insinuations, she had felt that James would be almost justified
in thinking the worst of her, and that she could have no defence
to offer which wouldn&rsquo;t sound like the flimsiest
excuse.&nbsp; But the pain in James&rsquo; head asserted itself
too cruelly for him to think of anything else for the
moment.&nbsp; He accepted the presence of M&lsquo;Crae as nothing
more than a curiosity, and the little that she told him seemed to
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>satisfy
him.&nbsp; A little later, when his enhavocked brain began to
clear a little, the horror of the night before, which had been
mercifully forgotten, stole back again.&nbsp; Suddenly, as he lay
there, with his hand in Eva&rsquo;s, he was shaken by a fit of
sobbing.&nbsp; At the best of times the sight of a grown man so
tortured is terrible.&nbsp; And he was Eva&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp;
The one emotion with which she had habitually regarded him was
that of pity.&nbsp; Now her compassion was overwhelming.&nbsp;
She would have given anything in the world to be able to soothe
him.&nbsp; He was clutching so hard at the hand in which his own
had lain that he actually hurt her.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae saw her
bending over James.&nbsp; He stepped through the open window out
on the clammy stoep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor, poor dear,&rdquo; he heard her say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is your head so bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James spoke chokingly through his sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pain&rsquo;s nothing . . . nothing.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve only just awakened . . . remembered.&nbsp; Eva,
I&rsquo;ve been in hell.&nbsp; There can&rsquo;t be anything
worse in hell.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d forgotten.&nbsp; Oh, my God, my
God.&nbsp; I shall never forget again.&nbsp; My God. . . .&nbsp;
My God . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; And he started crying again.</p>
<p>She could do nothing with him.&nbsp; Her own helplessness
amazed her.&nbsp; At times the storm of sobs would cease; but
even then the light of his reason shone balefully.&nbsp; The
words which he spoke were disconnected, and all were madly tinged
with the remembrance of horror.&nbsp; Again and again he would
say that he had been in hell, in the uttermost hell.&nbsp; And
then his fancy would suddenly be taken with the idea of <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;look, they&rsquo;re bringing
dry wood to the fire.&nbsp; The heat . . . think of the heat. . .
.&nbsp; Seven times heated.&nbsp; Nothing could live.&nbsp; The
stones are white-hot.&nbsp; Oh, God . . . God . . . can you see
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he would scream: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
coming . . . they&rsquo;re coming . . .&rdquo; and clutch at his
head and grip Eva&rsquo;s hand; and she would grip his in her
turn, as though the consciousness of her nearness and her
strength might help his lonely spirit.&nbsp; Once, indeed, she
found that he was stroking her hand.&nbsp; He had never done such
a thing before, and the action brought tears to her eyes.&nbsp;
But it was not Eva, of whom he was thinking.&nbsp; He said:
&ldquo;Mother . . . dear mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a little while
the violence and frequency of his fits of sobbing abated.&nbsp;
He babbled less wildly, and fell at last, as she thought, into a
state that resembled sleep.&nbsp; Indeed, she would have left him
if his fingers had not been still clutching her hand.&nbsp; Thus
they waited, until in the hour before their sudden dawn a
rain-bird sang.&nbsp; The sound was doubly sweet to Eva, for she
knew that the daylight was at hand, and in daylight she need not
be so frightened.&nbsp; But with the dawn she heard another
sound.&nbsp; And the sleeper heard it in his dreams, for he
surprised her by leaping up in bed, with terror in his grey
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The drums . . .&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you hear them?&nbsp; The drums of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">M&lsquo;Crae</span>, walking up and down
the stoep, and meditating on the strangeness of life, was aware
of the drumming which ushered in the dawn.&nbsp; In the ears of
James it awakened only memories of a recent terror; but
M&lsquo;Crae, more deeply learned in the ways of Africa, knew
that it portended something more than an echo of the
night&rsquo;s frenzy.&nbsp; The sound no longer centred in the
villages about the foot of Kilima ja Mweze.&nbsp; It came to him
from every point of the compass and from places where he had no
idea that there were villages at all.&nbsp; The rhythm of the
music, again, no longer followed the headlong triple time which
had been beaten out by the drums of the N&rsquo;goma.&nbsp; He
noticed that the rhythms were broken and very varied: almost as
if the hidden drummers were tapping a message in Morse or some
other recognised code.&nbsp; The change filled him with a subtle
anxiety: and in a little while he realised that he was not the
only person whom the sound had disturbed.&nbsp; On the edge of
the compound he heard African voices.&nbsp; Hamisi and Onyango
and another M&rsquo;luguru, a ragged savage whose business it was
to herd the mission goats, were talking together in high-pitched
voices.&nbsp; Determined, if he could, to find the cause of this
excitement, he <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>slipped across the compound under the cover of a hedge
of young sisal, and saw that they were sitting in front of their
shanty.&nbsp; The boy Hamisi was engaged in polishing the long
blade of a Masai spear: and the word which emerged most clearly
from their talk was the Swahili, &ldquo;Vita,&rdquo; which by an
inversion of sense peculiar to Western ears has the meaning of
&ldquo;War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae was troubled by this word, and, with it, the
somewhat sinister occupation which Hamisi was enjoying.&nbsp; He
knew all about war: the assegais of the Zulu, the Mauser bullets
of the Boer snipers.&nbsp; Africa is a land in which that fire
has never ceased to smoulder: he had always accepted it as part
of the continent&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; No more than that.&nbsp; He
had never dreaded it; but now it seemed to him that in some way
his attitude had been subtly changed.&nbsp; When he thought of
war he began to think also of Eva, and to realise that for a
woman native warfare includes terrible possibilities.&nbsp; Now,
more than ever, it occurred to him that Destiny had brought him
famished to Luguru to fulfil the part of a protector, for which
she had already, brutally, almost disqualified him.</p>
<p>He wished that he could read the message of these disquieting
drum-taps.&nbsp; Most probably, he thought, they announced some
forlorn hope of a native rising already destined to wither before
the German machine guns in the slaughter of black hosts.&nbsp; He
knew the history of German South-West and the end of the
Hereros.&nbsp; And he wondered&mdash;for he had lived so long in
Africa that he knew the humble ideals of its <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>millions&mdash;why these people should suffer our
civilisation in the hail of Maxim fire.&nbsp; Yet, even while he
indulged this vein of wonder and pity, he realised that a
European community so small and so isolated as their little
company at Luguru might very well be exterminated in the first
outburst.&nbsp; In his years of wandering he had learnt that the
best way of dealing with the African is to be direct and
truthful.&nbsp; He stepped out into the path, and Hamisi, hearing
his approach, pushed his spear into the hut and greeted him with
a very charming smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard you talking of the war,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I have heard the drums say the
same thing.&nbsp; What is this war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamisi smiled languidly, scratching his legs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no war,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have heard all that you said.&nbsp; And you were
making ready a spear.&nbsp; You were not going to spear lions
like the Masai.&nbsp; The Waluguru are not brave enough for
that.&nbsp; You had better tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea that his lie had been taken for what it was worth
seemed to please Hamisi.&nbsp; This time he laughed
outright.&nbsp; If the <i>bwana</i> knew that there was a war, he
said, why need he ask questions?&nbsp; The <i>Wasungu</i>
(Europeans) knew more about everything than the Waluguru.&nbsp;
They only knew that there was a war, and that they were going to
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you going to fight?&rdquo; asked
M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>Hamisi smiled, but said he did not know; and when M&lsquo;Crae
had questioned him a little longer he became convinced that in
this, at least, Hamisi was speaking <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>the truth.&nbsp; Somewhere in the
world, somewhere in Africa&mdash;perhaps no nearer than the
northern fringe of the Sahara&mdash;the smouldering flame of
violence had flickered out.&nbsp; He did not know then any more
than did Hamisi, sharpening his spear, that these angry
drum-throbs were no more than the diminished echoes of the guns
that were battering Li&egrave;ge.</p>
<p>He went into the house to find Eva.&nbsp; James, it seemed,
had fallen once more into an uneasy and exhausted sleep.&nbsp;
Even now his poor brain was haunted by the memory of the
night&rsquo;s horrors; but the watching had told so heavily on
Eva that she thought she had better leave him for a little.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae found her in the kitchen making coffee for
breakfast.&nbsp; She spoke in a whisper, as though she feared
that her voice might be heard above the clamour in James&rsquo;
brain.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sleeping, or at any rate
he&rsquo;s stopped talking,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; She smiled
quite bravely, but saw in a moment that some new thing was
troubling M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
now?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had wanted to keep it to myself,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need worry about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much worse could happen,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I could face anything now.&nbsp; What is he going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has nothing to do with Godovius this time . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you frighten me?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s war . . . there&rsquo;s a war
somewhere.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where.&nbsp; In Tripoli,
perhaps.&nbsp; The Waluguru know something about it; but I
don&rsquo;t suppose they <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>know more than I do.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose Godovius knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he first spoke she had gone very pale; now her colour
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too bad of you to frighten me like that,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you had heard something terrible
about . . . him . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took breakfast together in the little room, and the
atmosphere of that meal had a peculiar quality of lightness; as
though, indeed, they had just weathered a violent thunderstorm,
and were talking together in a silence which made their voices
sound small and unreal.&nbsp; By the time they had finished their
breakfast the sun had risen and filled the air with golden
light.&nbsp; They stood on the stoep together gazing out over the
newly awakened lands.&nbsp; Beneath the sun these lay in a vast
and smiling lethargy.&nbsp; Thus would they awake to-morrow and
for many weeks to come.&nbsp; Thus had they awakened for
countless centuries before the ships of Sheba came to seek their
gold.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae gazed fondly: there was no wonder that
he loved Africa: but Eva was far less conscious of this
revelation of beauty than of the presence of the man at her
side.&nbsp; Neither of them broke the silence: but from within
they heard the wailing sound of James&rsquo; voice, raised in
complaint:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A voice was heard upon the high places . . . weeping
and supplication . . . weeping and supplication</i> . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eva turned and left the side of M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; As she
passed him she laid her hand gently on his arm.</p>
<h3><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>II</h3>
<p>Into the heat of the day the rumble of war-drums never
ceased.&nbsp; Their sound contributed an uneasy background to the
wanderings of James.&nbsp; It was no matter for surprise that his
night of exposure in the forest had awakened the activities of
the hosts of fever which slept in his veins.&nbsp; Perhaps this
was a blessing; for now his body was so shaken with ague or
burned with the alternate fire that the hot reality of his last
horror no longer filled his brain.&nbsp; Eva sat beside
him.&nbsp; In the rare intervals of lucid thought his mood was
merely childish and querulous.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae, seeing that
there remained for him no sphere of usefulness in the house,
retired, as if by habit, to the shade of his <i>banda</i>, and
began to busy himself with the notes of his book.</p>
<p>He wrote in a cramped and undeveloped hand, but very
seriously.&nbsp; Even in the <i>banda</i> he felt the heat of
that pale sky.&nbsp; He wrote slowly, as one would expect of a
man for whom life was infinitely spacious and leisurely, with
long pauses between the sentences, in which, perhaps, he was
choosing the unwilling words, or even thinking of very different
things.&nbsp; At times, again, he would stop in the middle of a
sentence, remaining painfully still, as if he were
listening.&nbsp; He listened, but heard no sound beyond the thin,
clear note of a grass country under a tropical noon.&nbsp;
Nothing more . . . and yet a curious instinct prompted him to put
out his hand for his Mannlicher, and lay it gently at his
side.&nbsp; He went on writing again.&nbsp; Again <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>stopped and
listened.&nbsp; He was not happy.&nbsp; He wished now that he had
kept to his post on the stoep within call of Eva in James&rsquo;
room.&nbsp; He gave the matter a moment of serious
thinking.&nbsp; It was a pity, he thought, that he had come into
the <i>banda</i>, where he could see nothing: for now there was
no need of concealment, and a man was a poor creature without the
use of his eyes.&nbsp; His ears, indeed, had been so long attuned
to the condition of silence that they were quick to notice the
least sound of moving beast or bird and to distinguish these from
the noises which are made by men.&nbsp; Now he instinctively felt
that men were near.&nbsp; In this there was nothing essentially
dangerous, for Hamisi and the other boys might well be in the
garden.&nbsp; But he knew that Eva was tied to the bedside of
James, and that no African, unless he were going to steal, would
enter the garden of a European, or work without being told to do
so.&nbsp; And so he wondered, feeling curiously insecure.</p>
<p>He decided that it would be best for him to see for
himself.&nbsp; He raised his body, very quietly, from the heap of
sisal, and stole to the door of the <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; By the
time that he reached it he knew that he had made a mistake in
leaving his rifle behind.&nbsp; But then it was too late.&nbsp; A
group of armed Waluguru threw themselves upon him.&nbsp; They
were so many that he had no chance.&nbsp; In a moment he was
thrown to the ground with a gag in his mouth, while his arm and
his legs were bound with a rope of sisal fibre.&nbsp; He knew
that it was no use struggling.&nbsp; And, after all, this was
neither more nor less than he had expected.&nbsp; The only <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>thing which
struck him as strange was the costume of these Waluguru and the
arms which they carried.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t imagine that the
Germans had trained such savages for police, armed them with
rifles, and put them into shorts and jerseys.&nbsp; They dragged
him along the avenue under the flamboyant trees, and in his
hurried passage the events of the morning suggested to him an
incredible solution.&nbsp; War . . . there was war.&nbsp; Not
merely one of the black wars of Africa, but a war of white men in
which his own people were engaged.&nbsp; The magnitude of the
business, its possibilities in the wilds of Africa, overwhelmed
him.&nbsp; He thought of Eva. . . .&nbsp; If he had only guessed
that morning when they first heard the drums . . . if he had not
been so ridiculously unimaginative. . . .&nbsp; But now he could
do nothing.</p>
<p>In front of the house Godovius was awaiting him.&nbsp; Behind
him, in orderly silence, stood another dozen of armed
askaris.&nbsp; As the others, grunting, dragged in the body of
M&lsquo;Crae, the noise of this commotion reached Eva, and she
ran out on to the stoep.&nbsp; At first she didn&rsquo;t see the
bound figure of M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She saw only
Godovius&mdash;Godovius in the white uniform of the German
colonial army: and the sight disturbed her, strangely enough, not
so much because he was the enemy whom she dreaded most, but
because he happened to be wearing the uniform which she had seen
in the picture which had first frightened her in his house.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was all I saw,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
holding himself in the same military way, and looking so
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>He
lost no time in coming to business.&nbsp; He clicked his heels
and saluted.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a serious matter, Miss
Eva,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no longer here as your
friend and neighbour, but as a soldier of Germany.&nbsp; The
Fatherland imposes hard tasks upon us, but we have no alternative
but obedience.&nbsp; It is only this morning that the message has
reached me.&nbsp; Our countries are at war.&nbsp; This is the
work of Russia and France.&nbsp; England, their dupe, has had the
insolence to join them.&nbsp; It is a bad day for England in
Africa.&nbsp; It is the end of England in Africa.&nbsp; Your
brother and you and the man Hare are my prisoners.&nbsp; You will
appreciate the fact that I have nothing to do with this
personally.&nbsp; I only do my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through this piece of deadly serious bombast Eva had stood
bewildered.&nbsp; When he mentioned the name of Hare she came
suddenly, as it were, to herself.&nbsp; She saw the body of
M&lsquo;Crae lying bound in the dust.&nbsp; She saw nothing
else.&nbsp; She wanted to see that he wasn&rsquo;t hurt.&nbsp;
She hadn&rsquo;t nursed him so tenderly all those weeks for
this.&nbsp; She saw the veins of his bound arm standing out as
thick as the cords which bound them.&nbsp; His face was turned
away from her.&nbsp; She hurried to his side.&nbsp; The askaris
stood between them with their bayonets.&nbsp; Godovius shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now I see that you do not understand.&nbsp; This
man is a prisoner of war.&nbsp; However dear he may be to you,
this is the fortune of war.&nbsp; I could not help you to your
desires if I would.&nbsp; You will see no more of him.&nbsp; But
even in war Germany is generous.&nbsp; The Germans do not make
war on women or on priests.&nbsp; <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>You will stay here, for the present
at any rate, under my supervision.&nbsp; What the Government may
do with you and your brother later I do not know.&nbsp; The man
Hare will be shot.&nbsp; That I do know.&nbsp; But even so I
shall not shoot him.&nbsp; I shall not shoot him unless you
misbehave.&nbsp; He is your hostage with me.&nbsp; But you will
stay here.&nbsp; You will give me your word that neither you nor
your brother will leave the mission nor attempt to communicate
with others of our enemies.&nbsp; I must see your brother about
this.&nbsp; You will be good enough to lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot see him,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
ill, oh! very ill.&nbsp; He would not be able to understand
you.&nbsp; Even I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
understand . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry to hear of your
brother&rsquo;s ill health.&nbsp; It is the night air.&nbsp; The
night air of the swamp is very poisonous to a missionary.&nbsp;
It was imprudent.&nbsp; I have noticed it before.&nbsp; But I
will take your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed again, and turned to his askaris.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chekua,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lift . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; They raised the lean body of M&lsquo;Crae, and set
off down the hill-side.&nbsp; Godovius came very near to Eva, so
near that she shuddered.&nbsp; Again the nightmare of the
picture. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Eva,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;between us there should not be war.&nbsp; You see the man
Hare goes to my house.&nbsp; He may escape. . . .&nbsp; It is
possible that he will escape . . . possible, but not
probable.&nbsp; If he should escape, what will you give
me?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>III</h3>
<p>The next few days were very terrible for Eva.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was fortunate for her that her brother needed so much attention
and that his state harrowed her sufficiently to keep her mind
from the greater tragedy.&nbsp; James made a very slow recovery,
and she could not feel that she was justified in telling him of a
climax in their affairs which might fall with devastating effect
on a mind already torn by his adventure.&nbsp; Little by little
he began to talk more freely of this, and always with a
communicated awe.&nbsp; At first it seemed that he could never
recover his hopes, or his faith in himself.&nbsp; He was far too
weak to feel that he could ever return to the struggle: but in a
little while he began to realise that he must make a new
beginning.&nbsp; Then, as the fever left his body, and his mind
became less perilously clear, the old impulse gradually returned,
and he began to make plans for the new campaign.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall not be fighting
in the dark.&nbsp; I think I know the worst.&nbsp; Nothing could
be worse . . . nothing.&nbsp; If only God will give me
strength.&nbsp; I must not be beaten.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only
dealing with the same thing as the prophets and the early
Christians.&nbsp; If I were not quite so utterly alone . .
.&nbsp; And yet, if the trial is greater, so will be the
triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end she found he could speak to her almost
dispassionately of his adventure, although he never told her any
details of the affair, and she knew better than to ask him.&nbsp;
Indeed she knew very well that when he <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>spoke to
her it was really no more than a little attempt to share his
trouble with another creature, to evade the utter loneliness of
which he had complained, and that it didn&rsquo;t matter to him
whether she understood him or no.&nbsp; All the time it was clear
that he found the whole business in retrospect rather thrilling,
and even though he never once mentioned the crowning horror of
the night, he talked quite frankly of small things which he
remembered: of his passage of the M&rsquo;ssente River under the
rising moon; of the coarse grasses which had cut his
fingers.&nbsp; Indeed he might well remember those, for his hands
were still bandaged so that he could not hold a book.&nbsp; The
ragged wound on his forehead worried him: for he could not be
certain how he had come by it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember nothing
after a certain point,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know it
seemed to me that they were all rushing towards me.&nbsp; Perhaps
I cried out, and they hadn&rsquo;t seen me before.&nbsp; And yet
they must have known that I was there.&nbsp; The hill was full of
them.&nbsp; I just remember them all rushing towards me in the
firelight.&nbsp; I remember how white their eyes and their teeth
were.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Yes . . . I think I must
have cried out in spite of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the time that he spoke of these things she was
thinking of M&lsquo;Crae, wondering what enormities he might be
suffering in the house of Godovius.&nbsp; She did not realise
herself how much she missed him, what a stable and reassuring
element in her life he had been.&nbsp; She supposed that she
would never see him again; and though this seemed no stranger to
her than <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>the fact that they had ever met, she found it difficult
to reconcile herself to the prospect; for she had begun to think
that nobody else in the world could possibly look after him,
remembering, with the greatest tenderness, the time when he had
been so dependent on her care.&nbsp; She had never in her life
known a man so intimately as M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
suppose that another man like him existed.&nbsp; The impression
which she recalled most fondly was that of his absolute
frankness: the desperate care which he had taken to make their
relation free once and for all from anything that was not
strictly true.&nbsp; She was thankful that it had been so.&nbsp;
Musing on the strange story of his life, she was grateful to him
for having told her so much without extenuation or
pleading.&nbsp; She would have felt less happy if he had not
cleared the way for their friendship by abandoning the name which
he had worn as a disguise.</p>
<p>From time to time, thinking of his captivity and of what she
owed him, the last words of Godovius would return to her:
&ldquo;If he should escape, what would you give me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She knew exactly what that meant: and when she thought of it,
even though the idea were so unspeakably horrible, she
couldn&rsquo;t help fancying that after all she might trick
Godovius, that she might keep him to his side of the bargain and
escape the fulfilment of her own, very much as she had planned to
do when first he had threatened them.&nbsp; It seemed to her that
this would be a natural thing to do: that if she could screw up
her courage to a certain point she might manage to keep Godovius
going and give M&lsquo;Crae at least the chance of escape.&nbsp;
After all, it was the sort <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>of thing that a woman could easily
do.&nbsp; It might even be done without any too terrible
risk.&nbsp; But always when she allowed her thoughts to turn in
this direction she would find herself peculiarly conscious of the
absent M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s disapproval.&nbsp; She remembered how
gravely he had spoken to her when she had made her last
confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;It never pays to put things off,&rdquo;
he had said, and even though she couldn&rsquo;t persuade herself
that in this case it might not pay after all, she felt that in
taking so great a risk of failure and its consequences she would
not be as loyal to his ideals as he would have expected her to
be.&nbsp; And so, even though the project pestered her mind, she
felt that she was bound in honour to abandon it.&nbsp; He
wouldn&rsquo;t like it, she thought, and that was enough.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not as good naturally as he thinks me,&rdquo; she
said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not nearly as good as he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once when she was sitting beside James&rsquo; bed and thinking
as usual of M&lsquo;Crae, the voice of her brother invaded her
thoughts so suddenly that she found herself blushing.&nbsp; He
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just remembered. . . .&nbsp; On the night
when they brought me back there was somebody here.&nbsp; I asked
you who it was. . . .&nbsp; I remember asking.&nbsp; And you said
it was a hunter, a stranger who had turned up.&nbsp; You told me
the name.&nbsp; Mac . . .&nbsp; Mac . . .&nbsp; Mackay. . .
.&nbsp; No, it wasn&rsquo;t Mackay.&nbsp; I get things mixed
up.&nbsp; Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&lsquo;Crae,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was
the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to him?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t see him.&nbsp;
Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went away next day,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;I hope you made him comfortable.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the least one can do.&nbsp; Where did he go when he
left us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to Mr. Godovius&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; It amazed her to find that it was easy to speak the
truth.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae would have approved of that, she
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have done anything to prevent him going to that
house,&rdquo; said James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a pity, but
it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t think any
more about it.&nbsp; You were so very ill.&nbsp; And you
couldn&rsquo;t help him going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he is staying there still,&rdquo; said
James.</p>
<p>The irony of this conversation troubled her.&nbsp; She felt
that if she spoke another word about M&lsquo;Crae she must either
go mad or tell James outright the whole story of the
fugitive.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if I did,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t do
anything.&nbsp; It would only be a waste of breath.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She felt that she would like to cry.</p>
<p>She was so lonely and bewildered.&nbsp; It seemed in these
days as if she couldn&rsquo;t take things in.&nbsp; The
imprisonment of M&lsquo;Crae meant so much more to her than its
cause, the European War which Godovius had so impressively
announced.&nbsp; She knew that England was at war with Germany:
that she and her brother, still happily ignorant of the whole
trouble, were in reality prisoners on parole: but for all that it
didn&rsquo;t seem to her possible that this state could alter
their position in any way.&nbsp; Already, ever since they had
been at Luguru they had been prisoners serving an indefinite term
of solitary confinement.&nbsp; She could not realise <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>what war
meant to the rest of the world any more than to themselves.&nbsp;
Eventually, and bitterly, she knew.&nbsp; Nothing could be very
much more terrible to a woman than the prisons of Taborah; but at
this time the war didn&rsquo;t seem to her a thing of pressing
importance: it was no more than a minor complication which might
upset James if he knew of it and make his recovery slower, and
the excuse&mdash;that was the way in which she regarded
it&mdash;for M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s imprisonment.</p>
<p>Yet, all the time, in the back of her brain, another
indefinite plan was maturing.&nbsp; If the liberty of
M&lsquo;Crae might not be purchased by the offer of a bribe which
she could never bring herself to pay, there remained at least a
chance&mdash;how near or how remote she was quite unable to
guess&mdash;of rescuing him herself.&nbsp; If once she could
manage to seek out the place in which he was confined, it might
be possible for her to help him to escape.&nbsp; She remembered a
few stories of this kind which she had read.&nbsp; Women had done
such things before.&nbsp; They might be done again.&nbsp; A
knife, a rifle and food, that was all that he would need.&nbsp; A
knife was an easy thing to find; and on the very day of his
capture she had taken M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s Mannlicher from the
<i>banda</i> and hidden it beneath her bed.</p>
<p>As the days passed, and the sinister figure of Godovius failed
to reappear, this plan began to take a more definite shape.&nbsp;
She determined to make the most careful preparations for
M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s provision, and then, when everything was
ready, to go herself in search of the captive&rsquo;s
prison.&nbsp; And now it seemed less necessary for her to be
secret in her planning; for <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>James was still in his bedroom,
while Hamisi and Onyango, who had disappeared together with their
subordinate Waluguru on the day of M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s arrest,
had never since returned.&nbsp; Indeed she had been happy to find
that they stayed away, for now there was no doubt in her mind but
that they were in the hands of Sakharani as much as the forest
people.&nbsp; At length, having planned the matter in detail, she
decided upon a day for her adventure.&nbsp; It surprised her to
find how little she found herself dreading the event: it seemed
as if, in this particular, she had almost outgrown the
possibility of fear.&nbsp; Her violent memory of the House of the
Moon no longer disturbed her.&nbsp; She was even prepared to meet
Godovius.&nbsp; Nothing mattered if only she might free
M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>The day which she chose for her attempt was the fourth after
M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s arrest.&nbsp; During the interval she had
never left the mission compound.&nbsp; Now, leaving James in what
seemed like a natural sleep, she left the garden in the first
cool of the evening at the back of the sisal hedge by Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; The bush was very quiet in
this hour.&nbsp; The silence seemed to argue well for her
success.&nbsp; She herself would be as quiet as the evening.</p>
<p>She had chosen this unusual way of leaving the mission so that
she might not be seen by any lurking natives on the forest
road.&nbsp; The smooth peak of Kilima ja Mweze still served her
for a guide, and feeling that she could rely a little on her
sense of direction, she had expected to enter the forest at an
unusual angle and make straight for the hill itself and the house
of <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Godovius without ever touching the zigzag path which
climbed the terraces.&nbsp; She stepped very quietly into the
bush, and soon struck one of those tenuous paths which the goats
of the Waluguru make on the hillsides where they are
pastured.&nbsp; A matter of great luck this seemed to her: for
she knew that it must surely lead directly to some village in the
forest.&nbsp; She began to hurry, so that she might advance some
way into the forest before the light failed.&nbsp; She ran till
she lost her breath, and when she stopped and heard the beating
of her own heart, she was thrilled with a delicious anticipation
of success.&nbsp; It was all very adventurous, and her progress,
so far, had seemed so secret that she couldn&rsquo;t help feeling
that luck was with her.</p>
<p>It was not long before she was disillusioned.&nbsp; Emerging
from the path in the bush into a wider sandy lacuna, she found
herself suddenly faced by Hamisi, a transfigured Hamisi, clothed
in the German colonial uniform, and armed with a Mauser
rifle.&nbsp; With him stood a second askari, one of the Waluguru
whom she did not know.&nbsp; Both of them smiled as though they
had been expecting her, showing the gap in the lower incisor
teeth which the Waluguru knock out in imitation of the
Masai.&nbsp; Hamisi saluted her, and she began to talk to him,
much as a woman who talks in an ingratiating way to a dog of
which she is afraid.&nbsp; But from the first she realised that
it was no good talking.&nbsp; She guessed that these two men were
only part of a cordon of sentries drawn about the mission, and
that Godovius was relying on other things <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>than the
parole which she had broken so lightly.&nbsp; It hadn&rsquo;t
struck her until that moment that she had actually broken
it.&nbsp; In a flash she began to wonder if M&lsquo;Crae would
approve.&nbsp; It was strange how this dour new morality of his
impressed her even in this emergency.</p>
<p>From the first she realised that her game was up.&nbsp; She
saw how simple she had been in underrating the carefulness of her
enemy.&nbsp; &ldquo;How he would laugh at me,&rdquo; she
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rdquo; was M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She knew
very well that Hamisi, for all his smiles, had orders not to let
her pass.&nbsp; Indeed she was rather frightened of this new and
militant Hamisi.&nbsp; She made the best of a bad job, and rated
him soundly in kitchen Swahili for having left her in the lurch
when the bwana was ill. . . .&nbsp; Hamisi scratched his back
under the new jersey and smiled.&nbsp; He was evidently very
proud of his cartridge belt and rifle and the big aluminium
water-bottle which he wore slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>In the failing light Eva made her way back to the
mission.&nbsp; Rather a pathetic return after her plans and
hopes.&nbsp; In the dim kitchen at the mission she saw the packet
of food which she had prepared for M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She had
put the strips of biltong and the biscuits with a tin of sardines
and a single cake of chocolate into a little linen bag.&nbsp; In
spite of her disappointment she could almost have smiled at her
own simplicity.</p>
<p>For all that, the failure of this enterprise opened her eyes
to a great many things which she had stupidly missed.&nbsp;
Hamisi in a burst of confidence and pride in his equipment had
told her that he was no <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>longer a house-boy but a soldier, a
soldier of Sakharani; that Sakharani was going to give him not
five rupees a month but twenty; that he, being a soldier, could
have as many women as he liked wherever he went, with more
<i>tembo</i> than he could drink, and <i>minge nyama</i> . . .
plenty of meat.&nbsp; It became clear to Eva that Godovius was
busy raising an armed levy of the Waluguru.&nbsp; That was the
meaning of many strange sounds which she had heard in the forest
but hardly noticed before: the blowing of a bugle, and the angry
stutter of rifle fire.&nbsp; She began remotely to appreciate
what war meant: how this wretched, down-trodden people had
suddenly begun to enjoy the privileges and licence of useful
cannon-fodder.&nbsp; After that evening she was conscious all the
time of this warlike activity.&nbsp; All day Godovius was
drilling them hard, and at night she heard the rolling of the
drums, and sometimes saw reflected in the sky the lights of great
fires which they lighted in their camps.&nbsp; In the presence of
this armed force she wondered however she could have been so
foolish as to think that it was possible to rescue
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She knew once and for all that the idea of
succeeding in this was ridiculous.&nbsp; The knowledge that she
and James were really prisoners began to get on her nerves.&nbsp;
She could not imagine what would be the end of all this.&nbsp;
She almost wished, whatever it might be, that the end would come
soon.&nbsp; It came, indeed, sooner than she had expected.</p>
<h2><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two days the forest below
Luguru echoed the German bugle calls and the sound of rifle
fire.&nbsp; At night the throbbing of drums never ceased, and the
reflection of great fires lit along the edge of the bush reddened
the sky.&nbsp; During this time the prisoners at Luguru heard
nothing of Godovius.&nbsp; James, who was still keeping to his
room, had not been able to notice the absence of the mission
boys.&nbsp; Now he was quickly regaining strength and
confidence.&nbsp; It was strange how brightly the flame of
enthusiasm burned in his poor body.&nbsp; As soon as the cuts on
his hands were healed he began to consort once more with his
friends the prophets, and Eva was almost thankful for this, for
it kept him employed as no other recreation could have
done.&nbsp; Indeed, beneath this shadow of which she alone was
conscious, their solitary life became extraordinarily
tranquil.&nbsp; The atmosphere impressed Eva in its
deceptiveness.&nbsp; All the time she was waiting for the next
move of Godovius, almost wishing that the period of suspense
might end, and something, however desperate, happen.&nbsp; One
supposes that Godovius was busy with the training of his levies,
instructing them in the science of slaughter, flattering them in
their new vocation of askaris with the utmost licence in <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>the way of
food and drink and lust, as became good soldiers of
Germany.&nbsp; That was the meaning of those constant marchings
and counter-marchings by day, and the fires which lit the sky at
night above their camps upon the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>The failure of her feeble attempt at an escape had shown Eva
that it was impossible for her to help M&lsquo;Crae in the way
which she had planned.&nbsp; Again and again the idea of
bargaining with Godovius returned to her.&nbsp; It came into her
head so often, and was so often rejected beneath the imagined
censure of the prisoner that, in the end, her sense of
bewilderment and hopelessness was too much for her.&nbsp; She
could not sleep at night, even when the drums, at last, were
quiet.&nbsp; The strain was too acute for any woman to have
borne.</p>
<p>In the end even James, who never noticed anything, became
aware of her pale face and haggard eyes.&nbsp; Anybody but James
would have seen them long before.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking well, Eva. . . .&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t look at all well.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;re not going
to be ill.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve taken your quinine?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather wearily she laughed him off; but James was a persistent
creature.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t let her excuses stand: and
since it didn&rsquo;t seem to her worth while sticking to them,
she thought she might as well tell him everything and be done
with it.&nbsp; Not quite everything. . . .&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
tell him about M&lsquo;Crae, for she felt that his clumsiness
would be certain to <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>irritate her.&nbsp; She told him, as
simply as she could, that they were both prisoners; that England
was at war with Germany, and how she had promised Godovius that
they wouldn&rsquo;t try to escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose it will make any difference to us out here, so far away
from everywhere,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
didn&rsquo;t tell you before.&nbsp; And of course you were too
ill to be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first he was only annoyed that she had kept him in the
dark.&nbsp; Then his imagination began to play with the
idea.&nbsp; He began to walk up and down the room, rather
unsteadily, and talk to her as his thoughts formed
themselves.&nbsp; Eva was too miserable to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
monstrous thing.&nbsp; Here it may be nothing, but in Europe it
will be terrible beyond description.&nbsp; This is the awful
result of the world&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp; Europe is like the cities
of the plain.&nbsp; All the evil of her cities will be washed out
in blood.&nbsp; It is an awful awakening for those places of
pleasure.&nbsp; London and Berlin.&nbsp; Sodom and
Gomorrah.&nbsp; This is the vengeance of God.&nbsp; It has been
foretold.&nbsp; No war will ever be like this war.&nbsp; If the
peoples had hearkened to the word of God. . . .&nbsp; For He is
slow to anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eva had never imagined that he would take it so hardly.&nbsp;
She hadn&rsquo;t for a moment envisaged the awfulness of the
catastrophe.&nbsp; All the time she had been thinking not of the
agony of Europe nor of the possible consequences to themselves,
but only of M&lsquo;Crae, whom the accident had thrown into
Godovius&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Even when she had listened to
James&rsquo; very eloquent oration she found herself thinking of
the helpless figure which the Waluguru askaris had carried into
the bush, of the knotted veins on his arm beneath the bonds.</p>
<p>That evening the fires in the askaris camp shone brighter than
ever, the throbbing of the drums more passionate.&nbsp; James,
realising now the meaning of all that distant noise and light,
became restless and excited.&nbsp; He would not be content to go
to bed early, as Eva had intended.&nbsp; He said that he would be
happier sitting out on the stoep in a long chair, listening to
all that was going on below.&nbsp; After their evening meal they
sat out there together, and while Eva nearly fell asleep from
sheer tiredness, he talked as much to himself as to her.&nbsp; It
was a night of the most exquisite calm.&nbsp; Beneath them the
thorn bush lay soft and silvered in the light of the moon.&nbsp;
The upper sky was so bright that they could even see beyond the
forest the outlines of the hills.&nbsp; In all that vast expanse
of quiet land only one spot of violent colour appeared, in a
single patch of red sky above the German camps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see it burning there,&rdquo; said James.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is War.&nbsp; That is what War means.&nbsp; A harsh
and brutal thing in the middle of the quietness of life.&nbsp; A
fierce, unholy, unnatural thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but that was because she did not
want him to ask her any questions.</p>
<p>A strange night.&nbsp; From time to time the lightened circle
of sky would glow more brightly, the drums <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>throb as
wildly as if all the drummers had gone mad together.&nbsp;
Sometimes the unheeding distance muffled their sound, so that
only a puff of wind brought it to their ears, waxing and waning
like the pulsations of a savage heart.&nbsp; Once, in the nearer
bush, they heard the voice of a man crying out like an
animal.&nbsp; Eva begged James to go to bed.&nbsp; The nearness
of the sound frightened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay here all night,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Soon you will be cold, and that means
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was almost rough with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave me alone . .
. please leave me alone.&nbsp; I want to think.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t think indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they were startled by the sound of rifle fire.&nbsp;
All over the bush people were firing guns.&nbsp; They
couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; At first it came from very
near, but gradually the firing died away in the direction of the
forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must sound like that,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;in a
moving battle: a running fight that is passing out of
hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the drums and the firing ceased.&nbsp;
Even the fires in the camp must have been allowed to die down,
for the silver of the moon washed all the sky.&nbsp; The bush
stretched as grey and silent as if no living creature moved in
it; and with the silence returned a sense of the definite
vastness of that moonlit land, the immemorial impassivity of the
great continent.&nbsp; It was a beautiful and melancholy
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Europe millions of men are slaughtering each
other,&rdquo; James whispered.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>&ldquo;Now you will go to bed?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>He took her arm, as though he were really unconscious of it,
and allowed her to help him to his feet.&nbsp; They stood there
still for a moment, and while they watched, both of them became
suddenly aware of the small figure of a man running towards the
bungalow from the edge of the bush.&nbsp; His clothes and his
face were of the pale colour of the moonlight, so that he might
have been a ghost, and when he caught sight of their two figures
on the stoep he waved his hand.&nbsp; It was his right hand that
he waved.&nbsp; The other arm was missing.&nbsp; While James
stood wondering what had happened, Eva was running down the
garden path to meet him.&nbsp; Half-way they met.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae could see the tears Eva&rsquo;s eyes shining in the
moonlight.&nbsp; He had never seen her face so pale and
beautiful.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae came to the point quickly, too quickly, indeed,
for James, whom the sight of this passionate meeting had
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no time to lose,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My rifle is in the <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; I suppose Mr.
Warburton has a rifle of some sort?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course James
hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And food. . . .&nbsp; It may take us nearly a
week.&nbsp; Three of us.&nbsp; But we mustn&rsquo;t be
overburdened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James waved his arms.&nbsp; One can imagine the gesture of
this lanky figure in the long black coat with his head in a
bandage.</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Mr. M&lsquo;Crae.
. . .&nbsp; I hope I have the name right. . . .&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of this.&nbsp; Will you be
good enough to explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time for explanation,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that we have to leave
here, all three of us, as quickly as we can.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be
a hard journey in front of us, but I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s
better to be driven than to be dead.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it
comes to. . . .&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no time for
talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told them swiftly and dryly what had happened to him after
his arrest.&nbsp; How the askaris had dragged him to the House of
the Moon and left him, with hands and feet bound, in a shanty at
the back of the long white building; how the old woman whose
tongue had been cut out had brought him porridge of mealie meal
in a bowl, and how he had been forced to lap it like a dog.&nbsp;
Once Godovius had been to see him, bringing the pleasant
announcement that he was soon to be shot: soon, but not yet; that
England was already paying for her infamy in the sack of London
and the destruction of her fleet.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a year&rsquo;s
time,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;no swine of an Englishman will
be able to show his face in Africa.&nbsp; The black men will
laugh at you.&nbsp; You have already lost South Africa.&nbsp; The
German flag is flying in Pretoria and Capetown.&nbsp; It is
probable that you will live to hear worse things than this, even
though you do not see the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae did not tell them what Godovius had said <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>of Eva, nor
of the anger which had nearly driven him mad in his bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he came again
to-night.&nbsp; I never saw a man so changed.&nbsp; He was pretty
near the colour of his uniform.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I cut the
ropes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will you promise that you will not
attack me?&rsquo;&nbsp; A ludicrous question to a one-armed man,
cramped with captivity and weaponless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae had given his word, and Godovius had released
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are an Englishman and I am a German.&nbsp; That is one
thing.&nbsp; For others we have good cause to hate each
other.&nbsp; War is war, and it is our duty to hate.&nbsp; But
besides this we are both white men.&nbsp; At Luguru there is a
white woman.&nbsp; I will be frank with you.&nbsp; For the moment
our hatred must go, for we are all in the same danger.&nbsp;
Where the danger has come from I cannot tell you.&nbsp; Probably
it is part of your damned English scheming.&nbsp; The English
have always paid other races to fight their battles.&nbsp; You
know that this colony is now one armed camp.&nbsp; In every tribe
we have raised levies and armed them.&nbsp; My black swine, the
Waluguru, are getting out of hand.&nbsp; To-day I have shot seven
of them; but things are still dangerous.&nbsp; It may
spread.&nbsp; All the armed natives of Africa may rise against
us, German and English alike.&nbsp; They hate us . . . we know
that . . . and in an isolated place like this we shall stand no
chance.&nbsp; To-night, on my way home, I have been fired at by
my own people.&nbsp; They may try to burn the house over
me.&nbsp; That will not be so easy, for I have <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>a machine
gun.&nbsp; But the mission they will strip and burn without
trouble.&nbsp; You can think of the fate of your two
English.&nbsp; And I cannot save them; perhaps I cannot save
myself.&nbsp; Somehow they must get to M&rsquo;papwa, where there
are plenty of white men to protect them.&nbsp; I am a German
soldier.&nbsp; My post is here; and in any case I must stay and
teach these black devils what the German rule means in their own
blood.&nbsp; You are an enemy and a prisoner.&nbsp; See, I give
you your liberty, and in exchange you give me your word that you
will return here when you have saved them.&nbsp; I am taking the
risk of letting you go.&nbsp; If we meet again I shall know that
you too are a soldier and worthy of my nobility.&nbsp; Miss Eva
is in your hands.&nbsp; You had better go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had asked for arms, and Godovius, after a moment of
hesitation and distrust, had given him a Mauser pistol.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will put it in your belt,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall watch you go.&nbsp; You will hold your hand above
your head.&nbsp; Remember, I have a rifle, and you will be
covered until you are out of range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae had laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate all you damned
Englanders,&rdquo; said Godovius.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no sense
of seriousness.&nbsp; I do not do this of my own will.&nbsp; But
I love that woman.&nbsp; I would rather she were killed by my
hand than given to the Waluguru.&nbsp; And I wish her to
live.&nbsp; You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae understood.&nbsp; His journey to the mission had
not been easy: for his body was still cramped by his long
confinement and the woods were full of watching Waluguru whom it
had been difficult to <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>evade.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the present
moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are all about the bush round
the house.&nbsp; As I said, there&rsquo;ll be no time.&nbsp; Miss
Eva will put together some food, and I will slip out again to see
where the way is open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Eva&rsquo;s mind there was no questioning.&nbsp; In
whatever other way she may have regarded M&lsquo;Crae, she
trusted him without reservation.&nbsp; She had reason to trust
him.&nbsp; As soon as he gave the word she was ready to
obey.&nbsp; She remembered the parcel of food which she had made
ready for M&lsquo;Crae on the evening of her hopeless expedition,
and turned to go.&nbsp; The voice of James recalled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva . . . where are you going?&nbsp; You had better
stay here for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no time for waiting,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>James waved his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is for me to
decide,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The matter must be
considered.&nbsp; It is possible, sir, that your story is true .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva, I must ask you to hear me. . . .&nbsp; I say that
this man&rsquo;s story may be true.&nbsp; But how can we
know?&nbsp; We have no particular reason to believe him.&nbsp;
Think a moment.&nbsp; How do we know that this is not some new
deviltry of that dreadful man?&nbsp; After all, it is not
unreasonable to suspect a messenger who comes from that
house.&nbsp; We know nothing of him . . . nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we do . . .&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a matter in which a
woman is competent to judge.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a matter for a
man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>your brother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
one else to stand between you and the world.&nbsp; You know
nothing of the world&rsquo;s wickedness.&nbsp; No doubt, in your
inexperience, you would trust the first man you met with your
honour.&nbsp; Thank God I am here, and ready to do my
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your duty that I am showing to you,&rdquo;
said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;Evidently you haven&rsquo;t taken
in what I&rsquo;ve been telling you.&nbsp; Godovius&rsquo;s
natives have got out of hand.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re armed.&nbsp; If
you stay here we shall all be butchered, all three of us.&nbsp;
Of course I should stay with you.&nbsp; And I should rather kill
your sister with my own hands than let her be taken by the
Waluguru.&nbsp; We have to try and get away in five minutes at
the most, and make for the Central Railway, where we shall be
taken prisoners by the Germans.&nbsp; Perhaps we will not get
there.&nbsp; That is in God&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; But we must have
a try.&nbsp; &lsquo;God helps them that help themselves&rsquo;
may not be Scripture, but it&rsquo;s common-sense.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be reasonable, sir,&rdquo; said James,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going to be ordered about in my own
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The alternative is being killed in it.&nbsp; For
God&rsquo;s sake, man, don&rsquo;t trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James passed his hand over his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am wrong . . . I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; My
head&rsquo;s in a muddle after the other night.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Eva,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae, &ldquo;get
everything ready quickly.&nbsp; Five minutes . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>She
said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae turned to James.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;do you realise the awful responsibility that
you&rsquo;re taking upon yourself in the sin of your pride?&nbsp;
Would you see what you saw the other night, and your sister in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment he was very Scotch, and the actual intensity of
his words made them impressive. . . .&nbsp; Some peculiar quality
in this appeal made James crumple up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive me,&rdquo; he sobbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
forgive me. . . .&nbsp; You had better take her.&nbsp; If it is
to be, the sooner the better . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hurry up and get some clothes on.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
set out in pyjama legs and a black coat.&nbsp; Let me help you if
you are weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the pitiful figure had got over his sobs.&nbsp;
Once more he was formal and precise.&nbsp; He spoke very much as
if he were conducting a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have mistaken me, Mr. M&lsquo;Crae,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have given you my authority to take my
sister.&nbsp; You realise, no doubt, the trust which that
implies, and that we are quite in your hands.&nbsp; But my own
position is quite different.&nbsp; Perhaps you do not know what
religion means to a man, or how a man in my position regards his
mission.&nbsp; I was sent to Africa to devote myself to these
unfortunate people.&nbsp; I have a responsibility.&nbsp; If the
devil has entered into their hearts this is the occasion in which
they need me most.&nbsp; You spoke just now a little
contemptuously <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>of Scripture . . .&nbsp; I am a minister, and perhaps
it means more to me.&nbsp; At any rate these words, if
you&rsquo;ll have the patience to hear me, mean a great deal:
&lsquo;<i>He that is an hireling</i>, <i>and not the
shepherd</i>, <i>whose own the sheep are not</i>, <i>seeth the
wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You know who spoke those words.&nbsp; Mine must be the part of
the good shepherd.&nbsp; If I behaved as a hireling I could not
bear to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such a thing as reason,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae; &ldquo;I beseech you to listen to it.&nbsp; A dead
shepherd is of very little use to his flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James glowed.&nbsp; It was extraordinary to see the pale
creature expand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Mr. M&lsquo;Crae, that is
where you make the greatest of mistakes.&nbsp; It was a dead
Shepherd who redeemed the world.&nbsp; If you are a Christian you
cannot suggest that that sacrifice was of no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a matter for argument,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;I recognise your point of view.&nbsp;
Against my will I respect it.&nbsp; I think you are an honest man
and that&rsquo;s the best title I can give you.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
shook hands.&nbsp; It is an amazing commentary on the naturalness
of theatrical conventions that common men, in moments of the
greatest stress, tend to the most obvious gestures.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae, gripping the hand of James, noticed that it was as
cold as if the man were already dead.</p>
<p>They spoke no more, for Eva entered the room, carrying the
linen satchel full of food and a couple of water-bottles.&nbsp;
She saw the two men standing in <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
ready?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve settled
everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve settled it,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;But your brother will not come.&nbsp;
He says that his duty lies here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, James, but you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You poor dear, of course you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>James shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
argue,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. M&lsquo;Crae says
there&rsquo;s no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will all stay together,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She laid her hands on James&rsquo; shoulders and looked up at
him.&nbsp; He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Eva. . . .&nbsp; It is as much your duty to go as
mine to stay.&nbsp; You . . . you must fall in with my wishes . .
. you must be reasonable . . . you must be a good girl . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stroked her cheek, and the unfamiliar
tenderness of the action made her burst into tears.&nbsp; She
sobbed quietly on the breast of his black coat.&nbsp; Quite
gently he disengaged her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you must go, dear.&nbsp; I am trusting you to Mr.
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; God keep you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed.&nbsp; They had never kissed each other since they
were children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, James . . .&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy . . . I am perfectly happy . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae in a peculiarly
harsh voice which he did not know himself.</p>
<p>She slipped the band of the Mannlicher over his shoulder and
they left the house.&nbsp; Left alone, James sighed and
straightened his hair.&nbsp; He went on to the stoep and looked
out over the silent lands.&nbsp; The <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>growing moon now sailed so
splendidly up the sky that he became conscious of the
earth&rsquo;s impetuous spin; he saw the outstretched continent
as part of its vast convexity and himself, in this moment of
extreme exaltation, an infinitesimal speck in the midst of
it.&nbsp; Even in the face of this appalling lesson in proportion
his soul was confident and deliciously thrilled with expectation
of some imminent miracle.&nbsp; His lips moved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And fear not them which kill the body</i>, <i>but
are not able to kill the soul</i>; <i>but rather fear him which
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell</i>.&nbsp; <i>Are
not five sparrows</i> . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>He moistened his
lips</i> &ldquo;. . . <i>five sparrows sold for a farthing</i>?
<i>and not one of them is forgotten before God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae and Eva moved quietly through the garden.&nbsp;
The shadow of the avenue of flamboyant trees shielded them from
the moonlight, their steps could scarcely be heard upon the sandy
floor, and she could only see M&lsquo;Crae, moving swiftly in
front of her, where the blotches of silver falling from the
interstices of woven boughs flaked his ghostly figure, the hump
of the knapsack slung across his shoulders, or sometimes the blue
barrel of the Mannlicher which he trailed.&nbsp; She followed
without question, pausing when he halted, creeping forward when
he moved: and, deeply though she trusted him, she found herself
wondering at the strangeness of the whole <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>proceeding,
at its fantastic unreality, at the incredible perversity of a
chance which had sent them out into the darkness together on this
debatable quest.&nbsp; Her reason told her that the two of them
were in stark reality running for their lives: that in all
probability she had said good-bye to James for the last time:
that there was nothing else to be done.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t
believe this.&nbsp; It was no good, she told herself, trying to
believe it.&nbsp; It was simply a monstrous fact which must be
accepted without questioning.&nbsp; It was no good trying to
think about the business which must simply be accepted.&nbsp; She
sighed to herself and followed M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>At the corner of the <i>banda</i> he halted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait
here till I come back,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand in
the shadow and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared.&nbsp; He seemed to her to be making a great
deal of noise.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t understand it, for it
seemed to her that he ought really to be making no noise at
all.&nbsp; She wanted to tell him to go more quietly.&nbsp; She
felt inclined to follow him and explain this to him.&nbsp; For
quite a long time she heard his movements, and then, in a little
interval of silence, the sound of another body which had lain
concealed behind the <i>banda</i>, following him.&nbsp; Then she
wanted to cry out and warn him, or even to run after him.&nbsp;
She wished that wherever he was going he would have taken her
with him.&nbsp; She remembered his last whisper, &ldquo;Wait here
till I come back,&rdquo; and waited . . . endlessly waited.&nbsp;
It was not easy.&nbsp; It would have been easier, she thought, if
she had not been <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>left so near home.&nbsp; There, in the shadow of the
acacias, she had not yet taken the final, irrevocable step.&nbsp;
There still remained for her an avenue of retreat.</p>
<p>Here, only a few feet away from her, was the opening of Mr.
Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i>.&nbsp; The moonlight showed her,
through the doorway, the table on which her work-basket lay and
beside it an open book, which she had been reading only a few
hours . . . or was it centuries? . . . before.&nbsp; At the other
end of her dark tunnel she could see the angle of the house, with
its festoons of bougainvillea; and all this looked so homely and
safe, so utterly removed from the nightmare atmosphere of danger
and flight.&nbsp; These things, it seemed to her, were solid and
permanent, the others no more than a mad, confusing dream.&nbsp;
And there, in his little room, was James.&nbsp; The whole
business could be nothing but a dream which had ridiculously
invaded her consciousness.&nbsp; She felt that if she were to go
back to the silent house and find James, and slip once more into
the pleasant order which she had created, she might wake and find
herself happy again.&nbsp; And yet, all the while, she was
remembering the whisper of M&lsquo;Crae, &ldquo;Stand here in the
shadow. . . .&nbsp; Wait till I come back again,&rdquo; and found
herself obeying.&nbsp; Not without revolt.&nbsp; It was too bad
of him, she thought, to try her in this way, to leave her there
in the threatening shadow.&nbsp; Too bad of him. . .</p>
<p>In the darkness she heard a shot fired.&nbsp; Again
silence.&nbsp; Perhaps that was the end of it.&nbsp; But though
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>the idea
tortured her, the sound of that report did actually bring her to
herself again.&nbsp; It showed her that the danger was real after
all.&nbsp; She pulled herself together.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must wait
here until he comes,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even if
it&rsquo;s for hours and hours I must wait here . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not for very long.&nbsp; Suddenly she became conscious
of a shadow behind her, and before she had time to cry out she
saw that it was M&lsquo;Crae, who beckoned her from the end of
the avenue nearest to the house. . . .&nbsp; He stood waiting for
her, and though no word passed between them, she followed.</p>
<p>Their way led at right angles to the one which he had taken at
first, close under the shadow of the house.&nbsp; On the edge of
the compound he dropped down and wriggled between two clusters of
spiked sisal leaves.&nbsp; She bent down and did the same.&nbsp;
In a little while they were threading their way between the
twisted thorns of the bush.&nbsp; A branch, back-springing, tore
Eva&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp; They must have moved more quickly than
she had imagined, for her heart was fluttering violently, but
M&lsquo;Crae never hesitated, and still she followed after.</p>
<p>She wondered often how in the world he knew which way he was
taking her, for all the trees in this wilderness seemed to her
alike, and she had no knowledge of the stars.&nbsp; Somewhere on
the right of them she heard shots, and when the firing started he
stopped to listen.&nbsp; A ridiculous thing, that any man who was
running for his life should waste time in that way.&nbsp; The
first shots sounded a long way from them, in <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>the
direction which he had taken when he first left her; but while
they stood listening a group of four followed, and these were of
a terrifying loudness, beating on their ears as if, indeed, the
rifles were levelled at their heads.&nbsp; Eva had often heard
the echoes of Godovius&rsquo;s rifle in the bush; but it was
quite a different thing to feel that she was being fired
at.&nbsp; She shivered and touched M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. . . .&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bush magnifies the sound.&nbsp; They
are quite a long way away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But with the next shot something droned with the flight of a
beetle above them, and a severed twig dropped on Eva&rsquo;s
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re firing on chance, and they&rsquo;re firing
high.&nbsp; They always fire high.&nbsp; Ate you rested
now?&nbsp; Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, she found herself no longer tired.&nbsp; Her
heart ceased its feeble flutterings.&nbsp; She had reached her
&ldquo;second wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now they moved faster than
ever.&nbsp; Even though the bush never thinned, M&lsquo;Crae
seemed able to find a twisting way between the thorns; almost as
if he had planned the route exactly, yard for yard, and were
following it exactly, never changing pace nor breaking
stride.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in front of them, the bush grew thinner, and Eva was
thankful, for it seemed to her that now they were no longer shut
in a cage of thorns.&nbsp; A moment later they emerged upon the
edge of a wide <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>slade of grasses, very beautiful and silvery in the
moon.&nbsp; For a full mile or more it stretched before them,
unmoved by any breath of wind, and the night so softened the
contours of the black bush which lay about it that a strange
magic might have transported them without warning to some homely
English meadow, set about with hedges of hawthorn and dreaming
beneath the moon.&nbsp; No scene could have been further removed
from her idea of Africa and its violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep to the thorn,&rdquo; whispered
M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>She obeyed.&nbsp; But here, on the edge of the bush, where the
lower branches of the thorn-trees had pushed out into sunlight
and more luxuriantly thriven, it was not easy going.&nbsp; They
moved slowly, and in a little while Eva&rsquo;s dress was torn in
many places.&nbsp; Thorns from the low branches tore at her back
and remained embedded in her flesh.&nbsp; She was very miserable,
but never, never tired.&nbsp; In the bush on their left they
heard a melancholy, drooping note.&nbsp; It was the cry of a bird
with which Eva had grown very familiar at Luguru, and she
scarcely noticed it until M&lsquo;Crae stopped dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a hornbill,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp; But a hornbill never calls at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke the call was echoed from the woody edge beyond
their slade of grasses.&nbsp; Again on their left: and this time
very near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An escort,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
must get closer in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Towards the sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&ldquo;Yes . . .&nbsp; Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way into a denser thicket of thorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
can never force our way through this,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp;
Upright they could not have penetrated this spinous screen.&nbsp;
Crouching low, they managed to pass beneath its lower branches
where they drooped to the level of many fleshy spears of the wild
sisal.&nbsp; At last Eva found that they had reached a little
clear space about the root of a gigantic acacia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now lie down,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; She lay
down in the dark and the shed spines of other years drove into
her limbs till she could have cried.&nbsp; In this secret lair
they waited silently for a long while.&nbsp; They heard no longer
the mocking hornbill call, nor any sound at all until their
silence was suddenly shattered by a burst of firing over the
grass-land on their right.&nbsp; &ldquo;They think that they have
seen something,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&nbsp; You are quite safe
here.&nbsp; Quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so this firing ceased, or rather bore away to the
south-east across the line which they were following, and then
again to the full south, in distant bush, where it muttered and
died away.&nbsp; All this time Eva was lying with her arms
between the thorny ground and her head, gazing up at the flat,
horizontal tapestries of the acacia and beyond to a clear sky in
which the moon sailed lightly as though it were rejoicing in the
freedom of the heaven from any wisp of cloud to mar its
brightness; for all the cloudy content of the sky lay piled upon
the hills beyond which she had risen, in monstrous gleaming
billows that dwarfed the <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>dark hill-chains, but stood up so
far away that Eva had no notion of their presence.&nbsp; A little
wind passed in the night, and she grew aware of many dead or dry
leaves shivering all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae, helping her
gently to her feet.&nbsp; She was horribly stiff, but still not
in the least tired.</p>
<p>Now it was not easy to escape from their hiding-place, so
thick-set were the trees and so tangled about their roots with an
undergrowth as wiry in the stem as heather but fledged with
softer leaves.&nbsp; Eva&rsquo;s hands clutched at these as they
passed, and she became aware of a pungent and aromatic odour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, please,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;On a windless night that will smell
for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt like a naughty child at this reproof.&nbsp; She found
herself rubbing her hands on her skirt, almost expected to be
scolded again for ruining her clothes.&nbsp; That skirt, at any
rate, was past ruination.&nbsp; She felt inclined to laugh at her
own feeling of guilt as much as at his seriousness; for she
couldn&rsquo;t get over the idea that even if they were going to
die it would be just as well to make a little joke about
it.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s intense monosyllables worried her
and, thinking of this, she came to see that in reality it was the
man, and not she, who was childish.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
laugh,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he will think I am mad.&nbsp;
But if I don&rsquo;t laugh soon I shall simply have to cry or
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; She learnt a great deal about
M&lsquo;Crae in those early hours of their flight, realising that
he was as blind to the essential humour of nearly every
catastrophe as <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>all the other men she had met would have been: as
James, as her father, the minister at Far Forest who drove out on
Sundays from Bewdley; as every one of them, in fact, but the
second mate who had tried to make love to her on the
mail-boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t really a nice
man,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>In a little while they had pushed their way through several
miles of this kind of bush.&nbsp; For a long time now they had
heard no noise of firing, nor indeed any other sound; but at
length there came to their ears a shrill, trilling note of a
curiously liquid quality, and Eva knew that they must be
approaching water of some kind, for she had often heard the same
music on the edge of the swamp or near their own mission after
rain.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae was still walking a little in front of
her&mdash;never during all this chase had she seen his
face&mdash;and suddenly she saw his shoulders dip as he
disappeared over a grassy edge into a deep channel sunk in the
ground.&nbsp; She followed him cautiously, for she did not know
how steep the bank might be or what depth of water might be lying
at the bottom.&nbsp; Her feet landed on a bank of soft sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; In the dry
watercourse no drop of moisture remained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
think we are near water for all that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She could not think why he should be worrying his mind about
water when the bottles which they carried were full.&nbsp;
Already she was uncomfortably conscious of the weight of her
own.&nbsp; They crossed a second narrow donga, and then another:
both dry.&nbsp; At a third, sheltered by a graceful screen of
taller acacias, <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>they found a bottom on which there was room for both of
them to turn.&nbsp; The whistling of the frogs grew so shrill
that it hurt their ears.&nbsp; In the middle of the donga no
stream flowed; but caught in a series of shelving rock-pools a
little of the water of the last rains had lodged.&nbsp; It smelt
stale and was cloudy with the larv&aelig; of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we had better drink,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It is not bad water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not thirsty.&nbsp; And even if I were . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must drink it all the same.&nbsp; We must keep the
water in our bottles.&nbsp; We shall want that later.&nbsp; Drink
as much as you can . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He himself began to drink, ladling the stuff to his mouth with
the curved palm of his hand.&nbsp; She had never seen anyone
drink like that, and when she tried to imitate him she found that
she spilt more than she drank.&nbsp; Nevertheless she managed to
obey him, and now knew, for the first time, how parched her mouth
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must get away from this,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This place must be alive with mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her wrists and ankles knew that already; but the tangle of
swamps into which they had wandered was not so easily left.&nbsp;
It must have taken them an hour or more to free themselves from
its convolutions.&nbsp; When they merged at last into the open
air and could see the moonlit sky, they settled down in the
hollow of a dry river bed upon the edge of which the grass grew
high and rank.&nbsp; The bank of this stream <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>was strewn
with fine sand and made a comfortable shelf on which to lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are tired,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must be tired to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She denied him; and indeed, strangely enough, until that
moment she had not been conscious of fatigue.&nbsp; She even felt
a mild exhilaration: a feeling that it wasn&rsquo;t easy to
describe: and then, of a sudden, very, very sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wonderful . . . wonderful . . .&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>He told her that if she were to be fit to march next day it
was essential that she should get some sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
all alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you must realise that we
can&rsquo;t be . . . be quite the same as if we were living in a
civilised place.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t mind what I do for
you.&nbsp; If you trust me . . . if you realise that I reverence
you . . . that . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know that without asking me,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be a cold night,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re warm now.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s nearly two
o&rsquo;clock and the cold of the ground will strike through your
clothes.&nbsp; I want you to share my warmth.&nbsp; If you
aren&rsquo;t warm you won&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s
important you should sleep.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t take any
notice of it.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply.&nbsp; It seemed very strange to her, even
though she told herself that there was no real reason why it
should seem strange.&nbsp; And so they settled down for the
night, lying very close together, with M&lsquo;Crae&rsquo;s body
pressed to hers; and when, a little <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>later, she began to shiver, as he
had told her, and found that she had huddled instinctively closer
to his warmth, she felt him respond to her presence, placing his
arm about her for protection.&nbsp; Even in her state between
sleep and waking she felt her sense of modesty weakly rebel
against the idea that she should be lying under the moon with the
arm of a stranger about her.&nbsp; But when she reflected on the
matter it seemed to her that in fact she knew M&lsquo;Crae more
intimately than any other man in the world, and smiling to
herself at the strangeness of the whole business, she fell asleep
again.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae did not sleep. . . .&nbsp; He had many matters
for thinking, and even though they had made good travelling from
Luguru, having left the mission twelve or fourteen miles behind,
he felt that it was still his duty to watch.&nbsp; At this
distance from Luguru it was more than probable that their
pursuers would leave them alone, and particularly in the night
season, which the Waluguru fear; but even if he were free from
the menace of the armed savages, no sleeping man could be wholly
safe from lions in a country so full of game.&nbsp; He wanted,
too, in his own methodical way, to make his plans for the next
day&rsquo;s journey, to calculate how far their resources of food
and water would carry them, to set his course by that pale
starlight for the journey towards the Central Railway with its
relative civilisation.</p>
<p>He calculated that from the nullah in which they now lay to
their object must be close on eighty miles.&nbsp; Of the lie of
the land he knew next to nothing, for <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>he had entered the German province
from the north; but he knew enough of the general nature of
Africa to guess that the country would lie higher towards the
east, and that the rivers, draining to the Wami, as did the
M&rsquo;ssente, would be spread out like the fingers of a hand
from the north to the south-west, and farther south in the line
of the Equator.&nbsp; It seemed to him, therefore, that they
could hardly ever be wholly lacking in water.&nbsp; But he
didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; There was no way in which he could
know.&nbsp; He reckoned that if he were travelling alone he could
make almost certain of doing his twenty miles a day; but this
time he was not travelling alone, and he had no knowledge of the
strength or endurance of a woman, or how her delicate feet would
stand the strain of walking day after day.&nbsp; That night he
had made her loosen her shoes.&nbsp; He could see them now,
ridiculously slender things, lying beside her.&nbsp; It was not
the fact that they were unpractical which impressed him so much
as that they were small.&nbsp; Seeing this token of Eva&rsquo;s
fragility, he was overwhelmed with a kind of pity for her
littleness.&nbsp; He supposed that for all her high and splendid
spirit she was really no more than a child; and feeling thus
incalculably tender toward her, he found that, in the most
unconscious way in the world, the arm which he had placed about
her to keep her warm when she had shivered would have tightened
in a caress.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; He knew it wouldn&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; He knew that it would have been the easiest thing to
have bent a little nearer and kissed her cool, pale cheek: so
easy, and so natural for a man who loved <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>her.&nbsp;
But he had settled it long ago in his mind that for a man of his
kind to permit himself the least indulgence of tenderness would
not be strictly fair to her.&nbsp; He knew that if he were once
to admit the possibility of love-making between them there must
be an end once for all of his attempts to do what he had
conceived to be his duty.&nbsp; It would not be fair: and there
was an end of it.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair . . .</p>
<p>And so, lying alone with this woman so intensely loved, in his
embrace, he resigned himself to the contemplation of the vast sky
which stretched above them.&nbsp; God knows, it wasn&rsquo;t
easy.&nbsp; All the time there was a danger&mdash;and no one
could have appreciated it better than he did&mdash;of his
allowing himself to be persuaded that she was really a child and
that he was justified in his sense of protection: so that it was
not surprising that he found himself turning for an escape
towards the infinite remoteness of stellar space.&nbsp; It was an
old trick of his.&nbsp; Time after time, in the past, he had used
this expedient in hours of distress and disappointment.&nbsp; He
knew nothing of astronomy, and yet he had lived under the
stars.&nbsp; He saw now the great cloudy nebul&aelig; of the
southern sky, and that principal glory of the south, Orion,
mightily dominating the whole vault.&nbsp; He had always
cherished an idea these remote, compassionate spheres looked down
with pity on the small troubles of the human race and the little,
spinning world.&nbsp; What, after all, did it matter whether one
man were lord of his desires or no?&nbsp; In heaven, he
remembered, there was no marrying or giving in marriage.&nbsp; It
were better so.&nbsp; While <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>he watched, the great sky gradually
clouded over.&nbsp; No driving clouds were hurried past the moon:
only an immense curtain of white vapour condensed in the upper
sky, and in a few moments the moon was hidden.&nbsp; It grew
almost dark.</p>
<p>Next morning Eva wakened to a sound that was peculiar in its
blending of the strange and the familiar.&nbsp; The sky hung grey
above them, but the air was full of innumerable bird-song, so
clear and thrilling in its slenderness that she could almost have
imagined that she was waking to a morning in the first ecstasy of
spring in her own home on the edge of the Forest of Wyre.&nbsp;
She had never heard anything like that at Luguru.&nbsp; In the
garden at the mission she had grown accustomed to the harsh note
of the pied shrikes, a numerous and truculent tribe which makes
its living on the smaller birds.&nbsp; This first and ravishing
impression was a small thing: but somehow it coloured all that
day.&nbsp; A wonderful day.&nbsp; The sun rose swiftly on those
highlands, and in a little while her limbs lost their chill and
stiffness.&nbsp; As soon as she had rubbed her eyes and put on
her shoes they ate a little breakfast together.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae allowed her a little water . . . so very little, she
thought, and then they set off walking in the cool morning.</p>
<p>No man who has not travelled in the early morning of the
African highlands could tell you of the beauty of that day.&nbsp;
Their way led them over a wide country of waving grasses where
trees were few: a high plateau, so washed with golden light, so
bathed in golden air, so kindly and so free that it would <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>have been
difficult for any soul to have felt unhappy there.&nbsp; To the
west and to the south of them stretched these endless yellow
plains.&nbsp; In the north they could still see the bosky forms
of the Luguru hills, where all their troubles lay: but even these
seemed now too beautiful to have sheltered any violence or
pain.&nbsp; Once or twice in the midst of this atmosphere of
freedom and of relief from the intangible threats of Luguru Eva
remembered James.&nbsp; She recognised, I suppose, that he was in
some danger: she was grieved, no doubt, by the obstinacy which
had made him stay behind, and realised that it was very
courageous of him and very like him to have seen the business
through: but her own relief and bewilderment were so intense that
she was never vexed with the dreadful imaginations which came to
the mind of M&lsquo;Crae, and made him remote and preoccupied all
through that golden morning.</p>
<p>Little by little his sombre mood was beguiled by her childish
pleasure in new things, her young and healthy life.&nbsp; I
suppose that a man can know no greater happiness than walking
alone in the open air at the side of the woman he loves.&nbsp; In
these hours the whole living world ministers to his passion,
revealing countless and incredible beauties to eyes that are
already drunk with joy.&nbsp; So it was with M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp;
In the loveliness of Eva&rsquo;s gait, of her eyes, of her voice,
he was lost.&nbsp; The way was scattered with familiar beauties
which came to him invested with a strange poignancy when they
were shared by Eva&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Thus, in the heat of the
day, they rested beneath a solitary acacia <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>on the
gravelly crown of these plains and round the dusty flowers of
brushwood at their feet many butterflies hovered.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae knew them all well enough, but Eva had never seen
many of them before and must find a likeness for each of their
silken patterns.&nbsp; One that she loved was blotched with
peacock eyes of violet, and another wore wings of figured satin
in modest browns and greys, like the sober gowns of mid-Victorian
ladies: and at the sight of another Eva must hold her breath, for
it floated down on great curved wings of black that were barred
with the blue of a kingfisher.</p>
<p>All through the heat of the day they lay there listening to
the sleepy calling of the hornbills until they fell asleep
themselves.&nbsp; In the first cool of the evening they set out
again, leaving the country of tall grasses as golden as ever
behind them, and entering a zone of Park Steppe scattered with
trees from which the nests of the bottle-bird were hanging in
hundreds.&nbsp; Eva was beginning to be very thirsty: but
M&lsquo;Crae would not let her drink.&nbsp; Soon, he imagined,
they must come to one of the greater tributaries of the Wami:
there they would quench their thirst and camp for the night upon
the farther side.&nbsp; At the time of sunset they came indeed to
a sodden valley upon which the Park Steppe looked down.&nbsp; It
promised good and plenteous water, for the bottom was hidden with
tapestries of acacia slowly stirring, and a single group of
taller trees with silvery trunks and great, expanded crowns stood
brooding over the sources of some spring.&nbsp; On a slope of
sand M&lsquo;Crae noticed the spoor of many buck that <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>had
wandered to this oasis for water, and when he saw them his mind
was clouded with a faint doubt: for the hoof-prints had set hard
in moist sand and had been left there, for all he knew, as long
ago as the last rains.&nbsp; When they came to the bottom of the
valley they found that the bed of the stream was dry.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae searched along its course to see if any water had
been caught in the pools of rock: but whatever had lain there had
long since evaporated.&nbsp; Somewhere indeed there must be
water.&nbsp; So much they knew by the high crowns of that company
of smooth-trunked trees and by the luxuriance of the thorned
acacia.&nbsp; But the water was too deep for them.&nbsp;
M&lsquo;Crae spent a futile hour digging with his hand in the
sandy bottom of the stream: but though the sand grew cool, no
water trickled through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Eva.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have plenty of water left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Crae shook his head.</p>
<p>That night they made their camp on a hill-side placed a mile
or so above the bed of the river, at a safe distance from those
sinister beauties which are known to hunters as &ldquo;fever
trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eva was very happy, even though the
spear-grass had worked its way into her feet.&nbsp; She was
healthily and pleasantly fatigued.&nbsp; Never in all her life
had she spent a more wonderful day.&nbsp; She felt, too, that she
was beginning to know M&lsquo;Crae better and was glad of
it.&nbsp; Time had helped her to reason herself out of a great
deal of ridiculous shyness.&nbsp; Again they lay together under
the stars, talking of trivial and intimate things.&nbsp; They did
<a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>not
speak of James or of Godovius.&nbsp; Their talk was as light and
an inconsequent as that of two happy lovers.&nbsp; Indeed they
were already lovers, though neither of them had ever given the
other a word of love.</p>
<p>Eva fell asleep early, resigning herself without question to
the arm of M&lsquo;Crae: but M&lsquo;Crae lay awake long into the
night.&nbsp; He was thinking of water . . . always of
water.&nbsp; Their disappointment at the river bed had made him
very anxious.&nbsp; He had made certain of finding permanent
water at this level, and the bed of the stream was sufficiently
deep and wide to justify his belief.&nbsp; But now there was no
doubt in his mind but that he had set their course too far
westward for the season of the year.&nbsp; He had been aiming, as
Godovius had told him, for M&rsquo;papwa; but if he were to keep
in touch with water it seemed that he must make for the line
considerably farther east.&nbsp; The prospect which lay before
him, according to his present plans, was a whole system of dry
river beds which would mock their thirst at every valley and in
the midst of which they must surely perish.&nbsp; It meant a
whole revision of his plans, and, what was more, a waste of
valuable time.&nbsp; For, even though he had undertaken to place
Eva in safety on the Central Railway, the mind of M&lsquo;Crae
was never very remote from Luguru.&nbsp; He had given Godovius
his word that he would return.&nbsp; In some small particular
Godovius had shown himself to be a white man: at the last moment
his regard for Eva had been sufficiently strong to place her in
the protection of his only rival.&nbsp; M&lsquo;Crae had <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>gravely
given him credit for that: and if he owed a debt of honour to
Godovius, he felt himself even more deeply indebted to James, a
man of his own race, cursed with the courage and perversity of a
martyr, and the only brother of the woman he loved.&nbsp; Yes, as
soon as it were possible he must make his way back to Luguru . .
. even if he were to be too late.&nbsp; There was so little time
to spare.&nbsp; Once more, about midnight, the sky clouded
over.&nbsp; On the horizon&rsquo;s brim he watched the flickering
light of bush fires slowly burning fifty miles away.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>A cloudless and splendid dawn ushered in the first of the bad
days.&nbsp; They set off early: for M&lsquo;Crae was anxious to
make as much progress as possible before the extreme heat of the
sun developed.&nbsp; He had decided, in his deliberations of the
night, to follow the course of the dry river valley towards the
east, so that, at the worst, they might keep in touch with the
possibility of water.&nbsp; They marched all day.&nbsp; From time
to time M&lsquo;Crae would leave Eva to rest while he reached out
towards the valley of the river to see if any sign of water were
there.&nbsp; Time after time he returned with a solemn face which
told her that he had failed, and every time she was ready to meet
him with a smile.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t easy to smile, for though
she dared not let him know, she was suffering a great deal.&nbsp;
The little doles of water which he allowed her to take were never
enough to quench her thirst.&nbsp; Always, in the back of <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>her mind,
whatever she might be saying or doing, thirst was the dominant
idea.&nbsp; In all her life she had never been far away from the
sweet moisture of brookland air: but the country through which
they now struggled might never have known any moisture but that
of the dew for all they could see of it.&nbsp; It was an endless,
arid plain, so vast and so terribly homogeneous that their
progress began to seem like a sort of nightmare in which they
were compelled to trudge for ever without more achievement than
prisoners treading a wheel.&nbsp; Always the same level skylines
hemmed them in, offering, as one might think, an infinite
possibility of escape, but giving none.&nbsp; The dry bed of the
river was the same, neither wider nor narrower, and always
parched with sun.&nbsp; The trees were the same scattered bushes
of mimosa and acacia: the butterflies the same; the same
hornbills called to them from melancholy distances.&nbsp; Once,
in the appalling fatigue of the early evening, when a little
coolness descended to mock their labours, Eva realised of a
sudden that she was sitting under a withered candelabra cactus, a
gloomy skeleton that raised withered arms into the dry air, and a
haunting conviction assailed her that this was the self-same tree
under which she had sat in their first halt, long ago in the dawn
of the same day.&nbsp; The idea was almost too horrible to be
true; and, when she saw M&lsquo;Crae approaching, the same lean,
dusty figure, his lips parched with drought, the atmosphere of a
monstrous dream returned to her.&nbsp; Again he smiled, again he
helped her to her feet.&nbsp; He <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>was so kind, she thought, that she
could have cried for that alone.</p>
<p>At sunset they lay down for the night.&nbsp; They spoke very
little.&nbsp; They were too tired to speak, and the mind of
M&lsquo;Crae too troubled; for he knew that even if they found
water next day their food was running short.&nbsp; For supper
they chewed plugs of biltong.&nbsp; That night she slept very
little.&nbsp; When she was not awake she dreamed without
ceasing.&nbsp; She dreamed of Far Forest, and above all of a
little brook which tumbles from the western margin of the
watershed of Clow&rsquo;s Top to the valley of the Teme, and a
mossy pool of icy, clear water into which the thin stream fell
with a tinkling sound.&nbsp; When she was a child, returning on
hot autumn days from the wooded valley, she had often bathed her
flushed face in its basin, and let the water trickle into her
mouth, and so, she dreamed, she was doing now.&nbsp; Then she
awoke to the brilliant moonlit sky untenanted by any cloud or any
dewy tenderness.&nbsp; In the cold, dry air she huddled closer to
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; It was good, after all, not to be quite
alone.&nbsp; She decided that she would chew no more
biltong.&nbsp; She would rather starve than have that savour in
her dry mouth.&nbsp; It tasted to her like the dregs of
beef-tea.</p>
<p>A little before dawn he awakened her.&nbsp; Now he had
determined to take the greater risk and march due south.&nbsp;
Even without water&mdash;and the land could not be waterless for
ever&mdash;it would be possible for them to cover as much as
fifty miles, and he did not suppose that they could now be
farther than this from the railway.</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>It
was a bitter start.&nbsp; She found that her feet had become so
sore that it was torture only to stand; but she supposed that
when once she had got going it would be easier.&nbsp; He knew
that she must be suffering thirst, for he himself had taken far
less water than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You poor,
dear child.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be so very long now . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew it could not be so very long.</p>
<p>But that day was a repetition of the last: more terrible,
perhaps, in its alternations of hope and despair; for now their
way led them over a series of river valleys, every one of them
full of promise, every one of them dry.&nbsp; She began to hate
the temptations of their beckoning green.&nbsp; All the time he
was at her side ready to cheer her, and always eager to give her
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are brave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are
splendid.&nbsp; You are wonderful.&nbsp; A little longer.&nbsp;
Only a little longer . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards evening she knew that she could do no more.&nbsp;
After a longer halt than usual she made her confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. . . .&nbsp; No . .
.&nbsp; I know I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My feet are dreadful.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s worse than being thirsty.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t take
any notice of me.&nbsp; You had better go on.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t mind leaving me.&nbsp; I want you to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must see what we can do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
you mustn&rsquo;t talk such wicked nonsense.&nbsp; You know that
I can&rsquo;t leave you.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see what we can do to
your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>She
took off her stockings.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want to do
so.&nbsp; It was funny that in this extremity she should have
been troubled by any such instinctive modesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
expect they look awful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Her stockings had stuck to her feet, her poor, swollen feet,
with blisters, she supposed; but when, with infinite pain, she
had managed to free them, she found that the skin was smothered
with ghastly suppurating wounds in each of the many places where
the fine spines of spear-grass had pierced it.&nbsp; Indeed it
was a miracle of endurance that she should have held on through
the day.&nbsp; The realisation of her suffering was altogether
too much for M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; He caressed the bruised feet
with his trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you must have suffered . . . my dear one, my dear
one . . . your beautiful feet.&nbsp; You, a woman.&nbsp; You of
all women in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kneeling beside her in the sand, he kissed her dusty
ankles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been cruel to you.&nbsp; I have driven
you.&nbsp; And just because you were so brave . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been more for me than for you,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t call me brave.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not brave.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only what you make me.&nbsp;
If you call me brave I know I shall cry . . . and I don&rsquo;t
want to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She raised his head and kissed his
blackened lips.&nbsp; And then she found that she must cry after
all: but while she cried to herself her hand, all of its own
accord, was stroking his bowed head.</p>
<p>The peace of the sunset descended on the plains.&nbsp; The air
about them was full of a tenderness which is <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the nearest
to that of spring than any that the tropics know.&nbsp; A
rainbird on a spray of thorn began its liquid song; but this
battered and exhausted pair were too rapt in their own
bewildering revelation of beauty to be aware of any other.&nbsp;
The night fell.</p>
<p>They did not sleep.&nbsp; They lay together and talked softly
of things which had not the remotest bearing on their desperate
case: of the night when they had first met: the long evenings in
Mr. Bullace&rsquo;s <i>banda</i> among the whisky bottles and the
rest of the precious hours which now they counted as lost.&nbsp;
For them the past and the amazing present were enough.&nbsp; They
had no future.&nbsp; It did not seem to matter what the future
might be now that they had reached this most glorious end.&nbsp;
At the worst they were sure of dying together.&nbsp; To-morrow .
. .</p>
<p>To-morrow came.&nbsp; They watched the sky grow pale over the
eastern horizon.&nbsp; Gradually the outlines of the low trees
which had lain around them in silent congregation became more
distinct.&nbsp; The birds began to sing.&nbsp; Perhaps there
would not be another dawn.</p>
<p>While they sat wondering under the paling sky a strange sound
came to their ears.&nbsp; To Eva it sounded like the rushing of a
distant river.&nbsp; In such a silence the least of sounds could
be heard; but this sound came for a moment faintly and was
gone.&nbsp; Indeed it was more like the sound of water than
anything else: a mirage of sound that had come like that old
dream to torture her thirst.&nbsp; It faded away, and then, very
gently, it came again.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>&ldquo;I heard something . . . like a river.&nbsp; Did
you hear it?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something,&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae, &ldquo;but
I think I must have imagined it.&nbsp; It was like the noise that
the blood makes in the vessels near your ears at night, when you
are getting better from fever.&nbsp; I expect it&rsquo;s partly
the quinine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I heard it too. . . .&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be
that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about it,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had better make a start.&nbsp; Now
there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t let me carry
you.&nbsp; We will see how it works.&nbsp; I shall take you like
they carry a wounded man.&nbsp; You must put your arms round my
neck.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again they kissed.</p>
<p>He had lifted her precious weight, when she cried:
&ldquo;Listen. . . .&nbsp; I hear it again.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t
be imagination,&rdquo; and they listened together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said M&lsquo;Crae.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
God!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left her, and she watched him running into the bush, as
though this were actually the last train that was ever going to
grind along the length of the Central Railway, and he must stop
it or die.</p>

270</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> many hours Eva lay alone under
the thorn-tree I do not know.&nbsp; For a great part of the time
she slept or fell into an uneasy dream that hung midway between
sleep and waking.&nbsp; Now that her hope of water had been
renewed her thirst became a torment even greater than
before.&nbsp; Once again, in the middle of the hot noon, she
thought that she heard a train moving on the line; but by this
time the wind which had brought the noise to their ears had
dropped, and it sounded very far away.&nbsp; In the intervals of
waking, and even in her dreams, her mind seemed marvellously
clear.&nbsp; She found that she wanted to talk of the ideas which
whirled about it.&nbsp; She even wanted to laugh, although she
could not imagine why.&nbsp; And then, in her weakness, she would
topple from this pinnacle of exaltation, feeling her actual and
appalling loneliness, thinking miserably of James and of any
catastrophe which might have befallen him.&nbsp; At other times
she would surprise herself, or rather one of the innumerable
selves of which her personality was compact, engrossed in the
contemplation of some minute part of the multitude of silent life
which surrounded her.&nbsp; At one time, moving rapidly in the
red dust at her feet, she saw an expedition of black ants, many
thousands of them, extended in a winding caravan.&nbsp; <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>She saw the
porters stumbling under their loads, the shining bellies of their
attendant askaris, and the solitary scouts which they had thrown
out on either side.&nbsp; She could not guess where they had come
from or where they were going, but the way which they had chosen,
and from which no obstacle could dissuade them, happened to lie
over the ragged edge of her skirt.&nbsp; She dared not move, for
she feared that if she disturbed them they would swarm upon her
with innumerable stings; so she lay very still and watched their
column move past until the head of it wheeled away beneath a
fallen bough; and the thought invaded her brain, now so
perilously clear, that she and M&lsquo;Crae, in their long
adventure, had been no less tiny and obscure in comparison with
their surrounding wilderness than this strangely preoccupied
host.&nbsp; In all her life she had never been given to such
speculations; but that was how it appeared to her now.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are just ants,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
cannot see us any bigger than that.&rdquo;&nbsp; A strange
business. . . .&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; It was hard to
believe.</p>
<p>When, in another interlude of her dream, M&lsquo;Crae arrived,
the shadow of the acacia had moved away from her, and she found
that she was lying in the tempered sunshine of late
afternoon.&nbsp; He brought her water.&nbsp; That was the thing
which mattered most.&nbsp; And when she had drunk she found that
she was ready to tackle another plug of biltong.&nbsp; Little by
little the dream atmosphere faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a long time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
I wanted to make sure of everything.&nbsp; I can tell you
we&rsquo;re in luck&rsquo;s <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>way.&nbsp; We slept within a couple
of miles of water.&nbsp; To think of it!&nbsp; The railway lies
over the brow of the hill on our right.&nbsp; I made a false cast
for it at first.&nbsp; And there is not only the railway there,
but a sort of station.&nbsp; Now you can be sure of safety.&nbsp;
I can leave you happily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and both knew that he had not spoken the
truth; but she also knew that his mind was already made up on
what he still conceived to be his duty and that, however
tragically, leave her he must.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a man there working in the rubber.&nbsp; A
Greek I took him to be.&nbsp; And I told him about Godovius and
his levies at Luguru.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t send help from here:
but the stationmaster has sent a wire through to Kilossa.&nbsp;
Probably they thought I was mad.&nbsp; He was old and very fat;
but I saw his boys washing a woman&rsquo;s clothes, so I think
you will be safe.&nbsp; So now I shall take you to the edge of
the bush above the station.&nbsp; After that you will fend for
yourself.&nbsp; It may be difficult . . . but I know how brave
you are, you wonderful child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a little way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you
must let me carry you.&nbsp; I know that you&rsquo;re done, my
darling.&nbsp; No other woman could have stood what you have
stood already.&nbsp; If I put everything else aside I should have
to have loved you for that.&nbsp; You know how I love
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well enough.&nbsp; You must keep on telling me. . .
.&nbsp; But now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can walk.&nbsp; Do
they know that I am coming?&nbsp; Does that Greek woman
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;They know nothing.&nbsp; Only that a madman out
of the bush has brought a message from Luguru and has gone
again.&nbsp; When you get there you know that you will be a
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Germans are not at war with the women,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . .&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure that
you will be safe.&nbsp; A white woman is safe anywhere in Africa
with white men.&nbsp; If it were not so it would be impossible
for women to live here at all.&nbsp; But we must not waste
time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll put your arms round my neck and I shall
lift you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will put my arms round your neck, and then I will
kiss you; but I shall not let you carry me.&nbsp; You must be
more tired than me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been resting all
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall try,&rdquo; he said solemnly.</p>
<p>He lifted her to her feet and the trees swam round her.&nbsp;
She clutched at him, and it seemed as if he too were part of the
swimming world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see . . .&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was getting up suddenly.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m
better,&rdquo; she protested; and so he let her have her way, and
they set off slowly together in the cool evening.&nbsp; For a
little way she would try to walk, and then, having confessed that
she was tired, she allowed him to take her on his back and carry
her.</p>
<p>In this way they passed through a narrow belt of bush and
descended to a valley.&nbsp; Here, marvel of marvels, ran a
little stream, where water, coloured red with the stain of acacia
bark, flowed over a sandy <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>bottom.&nbsp; They halted there for
a moment, and Eva bathed her face, her arms and her bruised
feet.&nbsp; In all her life she had never known water so
wonderful; but they could not linger there, for already the sky
was beginning to darken.&nbsp; So at length they came to the edge
of the bush, and saw beneath them the valley in which the railway
ran, an ordered green plantation of rubber, some fields of sisal,
a cluster of homely, white-washed houses, and a little compound
in which stood a group of paw-paw trees burdened with gourdlike
fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have only a little way to go,&rdquo; said
M&lsquo;Crae.</p>
<p>There, on the edge of the dry bush, they said good-bye.&nbsp;
In the story of their strange courtship I have imagined many
things, and some that I have written were told to me, so that I
know them to be true.&nbsp; I have imagined many things . . . but
for this unimaginable parting I have no words; for, as you may
guess, they never met again.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>This, too, is the end of Eva Burwarton&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; I
can see her painfully making her way towards the station
buildings and the compound in which the paw-paw trees were
growing, turning, perhaps, to look once again at the dusty figure
of M&lsquo;Crae, clear at first, but in a little while becoming
merged into the ashen grey of the bush and the bistre of burnt
grasses.&nbsp; Perhaps it is true that they have never been more
to me <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>than figures of this kind, very small and distant,
struggling with feeble limbs upon a huge and sinister
background.&nbsp; One is content to accept them as this and as no
more: for an action of mere puppets in surroundings so vast and
so sombre were enough to arouse one&rsquo;s imagination and to
claim one&rsquo;s pity.&nbsp; Of all the actors in this lonely
drama it was never my fortune to know more than one: and it seems
to me that the rest of her story matters very little.&nbsp; If
you would have it&mdash;and for those who are in search of
further horrors there is horror enough&mdash;it is all written in
the Bluebook, or White Paper, or whatever it is called, which
tells of the persecutions and indignities of the English
prisoners at Taborah.&nbsp; One heard enough of these things at
Nairobi in the winter of 1916; one heard them with pity and with
admiration, but never with the thrilling sense of drama, remote
and intense, which underlay Eva&rsquo;s story of the months
before.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t stay long in Nairobi.&nbsp; For a
week or two they warm-douched her with sympathies and chilled her
with prayer meetings, and then they sent her down the line with
her unfortunate companions, and shipped her home by the way of
South Africa.&nbsp; That, for me, was the end of her story.&nbsp;
Perhaps she returned to Far Forest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know; but
I imagine that this was unlikely; for, if I remember rightly,
there were no more of her family left, unless it were an aunt to
whom she used to write from Luguru, an aunt who lived in
Mamble&mdash;or was it Pensax?&mdash;some place or other not very
far away.</p>
<p>In those days it was my business to visit German <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>prisoners
who were confined in the camp on Nairobi Hill near the K.A.R.
cantonments, a happy and well-fed company, very different from
our famished and fever-ridden spectres who had lain in prison at
Taborah.&nbsp; From time to time large batches of these civilians
were sent away to be repatriated in Germany; and when others came
to take their place, my curiosity would always make me ask them
if they knew anything of Luguru or of Godovius, for, whether I
would or no, my mind was occupied at that time by Eva&rsquo;s
story.&nbsp; Many of them had heard of Godovius.&nbsp; The story
of the woman who had been killed by the mamba was popular; any
lie in the world was popular that might serve to ingratiate them
with the hated English.&nbsp; A poor crowd . . . a very poor
crowd!&nbsp; But nobody at all professed to be acquainted with
James.&nbsp; I suppose he had not been long enough in the
colony.</p>
<p>One day my luck turned.&nbsp; It was my business to treat a
new arrival who went by the name of Rosen&mdash;something or
other.&nbsp; A Jew at any rate.&nbsp; He had been left behind
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Morogoro, had been taken
unarmed, had claimed to be a missionary, and had been treated as
such.&nbsp; Personally I am convinced that he was a waiter, and
an appalling specimen at that.&nbsp; When he discovered that he
was on the point of repatriation, he remembered that he had been
born at Kalisch, in Poland, and was therefore a Russian.&nbsp;
Anything in the world to keep out of Germany.&nbsp; You see, the
papers were full of the stories of bread riots and fat tickets,
and, for all his religious protestations, his only god, as far as
I could <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>gather, was his belly.&nbsp; When the day came nearer
he sprung an attack of fever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m prepared to admit
that it was genuine enough, but he certainly made the most of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Doktor,&rdquo; he said to me, clasping his hands
in front of him, so that I could see no less than ten black
finger-nails, &ldquo;it is probable that the next attack will
kill me.&nbsp; I have had blackwater fever five times.&nbsp; I
understand this disease.&nbsp; I have been for many years in
Africa, and if you will pardon me saying so, I understand
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So did I; but although I hadn&rsquo;t any possible use for the
swine, the mere mean ingenuity which he showed in his attempts to
avoid returning to Germany amused me, and so, sometimes, I let
him talk.&nbsp; He had lived in England.&nbsp; I must confess
that for a missionary he was pretty well acquainted with the
least reputable bars and lounges of the West End.&nbsp; Of course
he was a waiter . . . or perhaps he had been a steward on a
British liner.&nbsp; He was great on idiomatic English and the
slang of the nineties, and from time to time he would trot out
the names of Englishmen whom he had befriended or whose lives he
had saved in German East.&nbsp; One day he startled me with the
remembered name of Bullace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bullace?&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes . . . I knew him.&nbsp; Tell me about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Herr Doktor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then you knew,
no doubt, my old friend&rsquo;s failing?&nbsp; A sad thing for a
brother missionary.&nbsp; Twice I nursed him with what you call
the jim-jams.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>I
questioned him about Luguru, about Godovius, about James.&nbsp;
He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you not know what happened at Luguru early in
the war?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At last he had found a chance of entertaining me without so
much painful effort.&nbsp; He settled down to it.&nbsp; He was
charmed to tell me everything he knew.</p>
<p>It surprised him that we, in British East, should have known
nothing about it.&nbsp; Quite a sensation, he said.&nbsp; At the
time when it all happened he had been in Kilossa.&nbsp; He was at
great pains to explain that his mission lay near to that
place.&nbsp; Those were early days of the war, and all his
community had volunteered for work&mdash;noncombatant
work&mdash;in the field.&nbsp; They were all gathered together at
Kilossa, waiting for orders.</p>
<p>And then, one day a message came over the wire from a small
station near M&rsquo;papwa.&nbsp; The stationmaster, a fool of a
fellow, had been given a message about some native rising at
Luguru.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t had the sense to detain the
messenger.&nbsp; Madness . . . but the Germans were such a
simple, trustful people.&nbsp; A rising at Luguru, where the
levies of Godovius were believed to be in training; where, only a
few days before, a caravan of rifles and ammunition had been
sent.&nbsp; Still, the news was definite enough, and there was no
time to be lost.&nbsp; Volunteers were asked for.&nbsp;
Ober-Leutenant Stein, a planter himself, was put in charge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I offered to go with them,&rdquo; said the little
Jew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are a missionary. . . .&nbsp; You cannot carry
arms . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; says my friend, &ldquo;but
there is also a mission at Luguru, and the missionary there, even
if he is an Englishman, is my brother.&nbsp; It was my duty to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook their heads, he said; they tried to dissuade him;
but in the end he had his way.&nbsp; Had he not held the
Englishman Bullace drunk in his arms?&nbsp; Had he not, very
nearly, succeeded in reforming him?</p>
<p>He wept for Bullace.</p>
<p>They left Morogoro the next day at dawn.&nbsp; Twenty whites,
a hundred askaris, Wanyamweze, trained men.&nbsp; Stein in
command: a man who had been long in the colony, who had known
Africa in the Herero campaign, one of Karl Peters&rsquo;
men.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knew how to deal with these black
devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved quickly; and indeed the story went too quickly for
me.&nbsp; I asked him about Godovius.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Jew,&rdquo;
said he, shaking his own undeniably Semitic nose, implying that
no more need be said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Jew . . . and a very strange
man.&nbsp; You know the story of the mamba?&nbsp; A fine
organiser, and greatly respected by the Waluguru.&nbsp; Rather
too catholic in his taste for women . . . there were other funny
stories about him . . . but then, we are not in Europe; we must
not be too hard on the sins of the flesh.&nbsp; The tropics, you
know . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third day they came to Luguru.&nbsp; The people were
very quiet, cowering in their villages.&nbsp; Perhaps they knew
what was coming.&nbsp; The column marched in pomp through the
forest to Njumba ja Mweze.&nbsp; A pitiful sight.&nbsp; It had
been a fine house for <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the colonies, well built of stone,
almost like a one-storeyed house at home in Germany&mdash;in
Poland.&nbsp; Burnt.&nbsp; Absolutely gutted with fire.&nbsp; He
remembered the pathetic appearance of a grand piano, crushed
beneath a fallen beam, worth, he supposed, as much as three
thousand rupees, worth half that second-hand, now only a twisted
tangle of strings and a warped iron frame.&nbsp; No trace of
Godovius or of his servants.&nbsp; No trace of anything in the
world but ashes.&nbsp; Stein said nothing.&nbsp; It was a
dangerous thing when a man like Stein, a man of deep feeling,
remained silent.</p>
<p>Next they went to the mission.&nbsp; They had expected to find
the same sort of havoc, but, strangely enough, the house was
standing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went into the house myself and there
everything was quiet.&nbsp; I thought: &lsquo;God is great.&nbsp;
This is a miracle.&nbsp; They have spared the holy
place!&rsquo;&nbsp; I offered up a prayer.&nbsp; It was most
touching.&nbsp; There, in the kitchen, was a table and on it a
piece of woman&rsquo;s sewing and a work-basket.&nbsp; In the
bedroom, the very room where I had saved the life of Bullace,
another table on which there was an open Bible.&nbsp; But I saw
that the spinners had hung their webs across the room.&nbsp; I
saw a great big spinner [gesture] fat as a black chief, sitting
in the middle of the web.&nbsp; Ugh! . . .&nbsp; No man had lived
there for days.&nbsp; I thought of the woman whose work was in
the kitchen.&nbsp; I went to Stein.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;there has been black work, black work. . . .&nbsp;
These devils have killed them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stein said
nothing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;These people, the missionary and his
wife, had gone to Godovius for protection.&nbsp; Alas! <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>they have
shared his fate.&nbsp; Now there are three white people to be
avenged.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stein told the askaris to load their
rifles.&nbsp; He himself walked behind the machine-gun
porters.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now we will see to these Waluguru
swine,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; Stein was a man of few words but a
colossal courage.&nbsp; Later he was killed, up on the Usambara
line.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, you,&rsquo; he said . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down through the bush to the forest.&nbsp; There was
an askari who knew the Waluguru villages, and he showed the
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;We marched past the church, and I thought to
myself: &lsquo;It is right that I should go in there, to the
place where my friend Bullace worked and prayed.&nbsp; I will go
in and offer a prayer myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; I opened the door. . .
.&nbsp; Pff! . . .&nbsp; But the stench was too much.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; .
. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a Protestant.&nbsp; You do not know . . .&nbsp;
If you had been in the Roman Catholic churches in Poland [he got
it right that time] you would have seen the human-size crucifixes
which frighten the children with a big dead Christ.&nbsp; It was
on the pulpit.&nbsp; They had hung him there on the pulpit with
big nails.&nbsp; Through his neck was a carpenter&rsquo;s
chisel.&nbsp; The nails and the hammer were lying on the
floor.&nbsp; In his black coat he hung with his feet tied
together.&nbsp; He was far gone, as you say.&nbsp; Pff! . .
.&nbsp; Oh, it was very bad.&nbsp; And the black swine had
mutilated him in the way that Africans, even our own askaris, use
with their enemies.&nbsp; You know . . . Pff! . . .&nbsp; It was
too awful.&nbsp; I tell you I could not stay there to offer up
the prayer that I had intended in that place.&nbsp; I went
out.&nbsp; I could <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>not bear the sight of that crucified man.&nbsp; I ran
after them.&nbsp; I was afraid to be alone.&nbsp; You will
understand; I was not allowed to carry arms . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Stein.&nbsp; Stein said nothing: but I know that
his blood boiled nobly.&nbsp; Then the firing began.&nbsp; It was
just.&nbsp; Never was there such a revenge.&nbsp; We went from
village to village.&nbsp; Everywhere the fires crackled up.&nbsp;
Everywhere they ran screaming, the black pigs, women and
all.&nbsp; Stein had the machine gun.&nbsp; The askaris knew what
had to be done.&nbsp; By evening that forest was cleansed.&nbsp;
I do not think the Waluguru will trouble us again.&nbsp; There is
only one way of teaching savages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night we slept in the mission.&nbsp; There was not
room for all of us and so I and another gentleman went to rest in
a little <i>banda</i> in the garden on a heap of sisal.&nbsp;
There, too, the woman had been.&nbsp; It pained our hearts to
think of that woman.&nbsp; But we knew she had been
avenged.&nbsp; We had done our duty, even for our enemies.&nbsp;
The place was full of whisky bottles.&nbsp; Worse luck! [idiom]
they were all empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the end of it.&nbsp; Next day we left
Luguru.&nbsp; We never found the woman.&nbsp; I expect she went
to Godovius.&nbsp; Trust Godovius for that.&nbsp; But one more
thing we found.&nbsp; It was the body of another man, or as much
as the hyenas and the white ants had left.&nbsp; No doubt he was
an Englishman, though we did not know there was another
there.&nbsp; He had a rifle with him, a Mannlicher, which I
should have liked myself if I had not been forbidden to carry
arms.&nbsp; The white ants had eaten most of his clothes and some
wild <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>beast had carried away one arm: but he had on him a
little packet of letters, or rather notes.&nbsp; I picked them up
and put them in my pocket, thinking there might be paper money
therewith.&nbsp; If I had taken money it would not have harmed
him.&nbsp; When I began to examine it I found that it was all
written in English.&nbsp; He wrote badly, like a child, that man;
and you may believe me or not&mdash;it was all notes on places in
our colony: on good water holes and winter streams and things of
that kind.&nbsp; It was an affair for the General Staff.&nbsp;
You see he was a spy . . . an English spy, who had been killed by
thirst or sickness and had his arm carried off by the
hyenas.&nbsp; A brave man, perhaps.&nbsp; So . . . it was the
right death for a spy.&nbsp; See, this was in the early days of
the war, and already your spies were near Luguru!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Herr Doktor, you see how weak I am.&nbsp; You
see how this simple story had tired me?&nbsp; Ah . . . this
accursed climate!&nbsp; It weakens all of us.&nbsp; I think you
too are pale.&nbsp; It will be a long time before I am fit to
travel . . . the strain of a sea voyage.&nbsp; Is it not
true?&nbsp; How can I thank you for all you have done for
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have pressed my hand.</p>
<p>I left him.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the day was heavier
than usual.&nbsp; I wished that the rains would come and have
done with all this alternating oppression and boisterous
wind.&nbsp; I left the camp.&nbsp; I went past a little garden
where the children of some prisoners, little creatures with
flaxen hair and blue eyes, were playing at soldiers, and walked
due south until I came to the escarpment of the hills.&nbsp;
Below me <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>the levels of the Athi plains stretched without end,
dun-coloured and dappled with huge shadows like the upper waters
of the Bristol Channel, or rather of some vaster and more gloomy
sea.&nbsp; It was an impressive and wholly soothing scene.&nbsp;
I sat there until the sun had set, and on the remotest horizon
the shadow of Kilimanjaro, a hundred miles away, rose against the
sky.&nbsp; I sat there till it grew dark, and the great plains
faded from me, thinking of the three men who died at Luguru: of
James the martyr predestinate; of Godovius consumed in the flames
which he had kindled; of M&lsquo;Crae whom Eva Burwarton had
loved.&nbsp; It was very still.&nbsp; All the shallow life of
Nairobi might have been as far away as the great mountain&rsquo;s
filmy shadow.&nbsp; And then, when I turned to make my way back
in the darkness to the club, a sudden sound startled me.&nbsp; It
was the beating of a drum in the lines of the King&rsquo;s
African Rifles.&nbsp; I stopped.&nbsp; In that moment I knew that
for all our pretences of civilisation I was still living in a
wholly savage land.&nbsp; I looked up to the sky, to the south
with its strange spaces and unfamiliar stars.&nbsp; I saw Orion,
the old hunter, stretched across the vault.&nbsp; The beating of
the drum awakened some ancient adventurous spirit in my
blood.&nbsp; I knew that this was the land above all others which
men of European race have never conquered.&nbsp; It was a strange
moment, full of a peculiar, half-bitter ecstasy.&nbsp; I gazed at
the stars and murmured to myself: &ldquo;This is Africa. . .

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
